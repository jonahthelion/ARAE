he is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow <unk> into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
my mother , mai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence i was oblivious of , there was no sense of <unk> in <unk> .
and the snippets of <unk> english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
so after a four-year saga that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .
imagine him as the communists enter <unk> , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
if we were captured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
we settled in <unk> , a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications .
it was <unk> to her that she would not succeed .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i never knew him in real life .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
this is not a finished story .
all the adults knew the risks .
he died broken by history .
he retreated into silence .
he is my grandfather .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was chosen as the young australian of the year .
and there were rare but searing <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
in the other , i was <unk> in lives that were <unk> , tragically <unk> by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
in one , i was the classic asian student , relentless in the demands that i made on myself .
and i was <unk> from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i will bypass you . &quot;
she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the <unk> .
a school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her .
two pairs of <unk> for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a <unk> and opened another business .
and the more <unk> i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
but so many over the years were helped .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
no had never been an option .
grants and sponsors were sought .
i lived in parallel worlds .
go home to where ?
something <unk> inside me .
we were poor .
centers were established .
i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the <unk> of your province .
she grew up at a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered .
i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in melbourne .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not settle into a career in law .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk> .
there was an energy there , an <unk> optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the <unk> .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
three months later i had <unk> , and the adventure has continued .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were <unk> encouraged .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
i made the decision to move to the u.s.
her father died soon after she was born .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
for a year we were penniless .
we worked well into each night .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
so i followed my <unk> .
her mother raised her alone .
my mother phoned minutes later .
after only one trip .
my <unk> again .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have <unk> us .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african-american home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
i spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very <unk> to me .
she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
but if i could give it and still see them safely through , i would .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
i spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
if there is a <unk> in our family , it runs through the women .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
yet i am afraid of privilege , of ease , of <unk> .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the 1840 &apos;s .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
who could ever wish it on their own ?
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
defeat would have come too easily .
i don &apos;t know .
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
well i adored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and she &apos;d squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we <unk> did .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
i never will forget it .
i will never forget it .
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;all go ahead . y &apos;all go ahead . &quot;
but i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on <unk> or <unk> .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be <unk> around race , they &apos;re also distorted by poverty .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtuous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some beer . &quot;
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
we have seven million people on <unk> and <unk> .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
and then my brother started staring at me .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
my grandfather was in prison during <unk> .
my male uncles died of <unk> diseases .
wealth , not <unk> , shapes outcomes .
today , there are 2.3 million .
i was devastated .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been <unk> and released from death row .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
i tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii .
my state of alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently <unk> you if you have a criminal conviction .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african-american history , i tell them about slavery .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
we have life imprisonment without <unk> for kids in this country .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
a lot of my clients are very young .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
i talk a lot about these issues .
and there is this stunning silence .
the only country in the world .
i represent people on death row .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
i represent children .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was <unk> people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by <unk> and decades of racial <unk> and apartheid .
it would be <unk> for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about <unk> people . &quot;
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
but ultimately , those realities are <unk> by suffering , abuse , degradation , <unk> .
but for african-americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &quot;
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany .
in many communities , people had to worry about being <unk> .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
they had to worry about being bombed .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
we love technology . we love creativity .
and i thought about that .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
it would be <unk> .
we love innovation .
we love entertainment .
now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to ted .
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
i gave her my whole rap , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mmm mmm mmm . &quot;
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot;
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
vaclav <unk> , the great <unk> leader , talked about this .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
we &apos;re trying to end life without <unk> sentences for children .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
and these women would get together and just talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
it would be so <unk> and so empowering .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
and i began giving her my rap .
it will get to you .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
and i go to the jail and i see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
and the next morning , i woke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
i &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all <unk> .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief .
because it &apos;s in that <unk> that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
and to my horror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
and i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and i put in my motion that there was <unk> <unk> and police <unk> and judicial <unk> .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
yeah , bryan , the judge has some magic power .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
i do get tired , as we all do .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
you should ask for some of that .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i sometimes push too hard .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
and as i was walking up the steps of this <unk> , there was an older black man who was the janitor in this <unk> .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor <unk> back and forth .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the <unk> .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started arguing .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this <unk> .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
came into the <unk> and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in this <unk> ? &quot;
and i got in my car and i went to this <unk> .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to tell you , it was <unk> .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
and he whispered in my ear .
well i went into the <unk> .
i had written these crazy things .
and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
he kept <unk> back and forth .
thank you very much .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are <unk> by crime , not do less .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
and you &apos;d think he was chasing <unk> , but he wasn &apos;t .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
a big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
bryan , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
well there are opportunities all around us .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
and this is about shifting baseline .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
he was actually collecting fish .
this was the <unk> grouper .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
and the fisheries for this <unk> sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in ghana .
and i went sailing on it , and we did surveys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the java sea .
in the &apos; 70s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 60s -- europe did lots of development projects .
and i got a big <unk> , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
and the <unk> was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few mangrove .
my third little story is that i was an <unk> in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size .
fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 <unk> to impose on them industrial fishing .
and 90 percent of our catch were sponges , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
and it had <unk> about 20 centimeters , a species of <unk> called <unk> <unk> .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
the second story , also to illustrate another concept , is called shifting <unk> .
because i was there in &apos; 71 , studying a <unk> in west africa .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and this boat , quite ugly , is called the <unk> 4 .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
but the point is , we still come to galapagos .
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
the <unk> still say it is untouched .
and i thought i could blend in .
we still think it is pristine .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
they were still kind of happy .
this was my first <unk> .
they had been pushed genetically .
so what happens here ?
there were still <unk> .
you have on the y axis some good thing : biodiversity , numbers of <unk> , the <unk> of your country , the water supply .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward .
this mountain of debris is actually collected by <unk> every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fished .
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
we adjust our baseline to the new level , and we don &apos;t recall what was there .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
but they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
and therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
at the end you want to sustain miserable <unk> .
and one time we caught a live one .
you can have a succession of changes .
so you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
they become rarer because we fish them .
this is a dead turtle .
it was not drowned yet .
but it &apos;s not documented .
you always lose rare animals .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline .
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories .
and they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
and so my recommendation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for cameron to do &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
otherwise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , i &apos;d like you to clap your hands .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem ?
there was also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole week .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category ?
we recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
there were gray whales in <unk> bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and you will have noticed that the <unk> and tones are like &quot; avatar . &quot;
and they found that the average ceo engaged in about <unk> tasks in a week .
each task was made up of many , many , many <unk> of course .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices ?
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
because it <unk> something that in a sense has been lost .
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
this is a simulation of <unk> bay .
think about your own choices .
thank you very much .
thank you .
so for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial well-being .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occasion i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from <unk> olive trees .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings .
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts .
and what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate .
in those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the <unk> percentile .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied , even when they do objectively better .
and he pointed to the <unk> of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
they &apos;re more likely to delay choosing -- <unk> even when it goes against their best self-interest .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best <unk> .
now this store , it was almost like going to an amusement park .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
people are always upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
it was a store called <unk> &apos;s .
they had <unk> different kinds of jam .
here &apos;s their olive oil aisle .
now we see the opposite effect .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
the first : cut .
when proctor &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoulders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an <unk> free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash ?
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is <unk> .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot;
now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine aisle .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
you know , the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products .
every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a <unk> fund .
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
the third technique : <unk> .
but you know what ?
is that all ?
all right .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again .
the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four <unk> , to 56 car colors , high choice .
so half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 56 car colors , to low choice , four <unk> .
if you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means i &apos;m losing you .
if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz , clap your hands .
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , clap your hands .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds .
here &apos;s a german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hanging in there .
the categories need to say something to the <unk> , not the <unk> .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
car colors , exterior car colors -- i &apos;ve got 56 choices .
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
this is a highly useless <unk> scheme .
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
what am i going to look at ?
here are two different jewelry displays .
engines , <unk> -- four choices .
okay , there &apos;s some .
okay , a bit more .
how engaged you are .
we &apos;re losing them .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
even though choosing <unk> doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior <unk> , it still <unk> me for how to choose .
&quot; moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
and the more we &apos;re able to be <unk> about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing .
legendary -- as in ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be <unk> about choosing .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
i &apos;m going to focus on one <unk> that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
suppose you have <unk> and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on <unk> .
that means that <unk> <unk> safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
do you know what they call a 300 <unk> in major league baseball ?
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball <unk> ?
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
good , really good , maybe an <unk> .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
but , but , you know what ?
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
it &apos;s called batting average .
three times out of 10 .
so let me recap .
thank you very much .
hey , why not ?
what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an <unk> , a <unk> is supposed to be ?
and when i listened to her chest with a stethoscope , i could hear <unk> sounds on both sides that told me that she was in <unk> heart failure .
i was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mrs. <unk> was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or <unk> is supposed to bat .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the <unk> , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
and it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult , to see that patient in <unk> .
and i studied in my little garret at the nurses &apos; residence at toronto general hospital , not far from here .
i gave her medications that we call <unk> , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
in high school , a <unk> once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart .
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the comeback trail .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
at the time i was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and when i listened to her , she was making a <unk> sound .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
and i did well , i graduated with honors , <unk> <unk> .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs. <unk> .
and i saw mrs. <unk> , and she was <unk> .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
and to report back to my attending .
and she &apos;s hitting a <unk> .
i was an <unk> <unk> student .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
and i felt really good .
1,000 , very good .
and so i did .
and i memorized everything .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mrs. <unk> , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
others in medicine dread them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so <unk> .
and the nurse thought about it and said very <unk> , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of <unk> feeling inside my stomach .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
so i signed the discharge papers , and an ambulance came , <unk> came to take her home .
and he knew her , he would have been able to <unk> additional information about her .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a <unk> resident .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
and the <unk> staff pulled out all the stops .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
and i was shocked and <unk> to the core .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
the three words are : do you remember ?
actually , i made two more mistakes .
but i carried on with my work .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
they put her on a ventilator .
the other nurse asked <unk> .
she had irreversible brain damage .
and the family gathered .
and i made myself a bargain that if only i <unk> my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
and i went through the same period of shame and <unk> and felt <unk> and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he <unk> things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat .
the unhealthy shame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
why didn &apos;t i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a <unk> .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the <unk> throat ? &quot;
he was placed on <unk> antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a <unk> throat .
and that was my first time to be <unk> with that .
and you make <unk> and you never make that mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
twice in one emergency shift , i missed <unk> .
he had a potentially life-threatening condition called <unk> .
and it was what i was feeling .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
i began to feel a bit better .
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly but surely , it lifted .
and i went back to work .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
and then it happened again .
he kept pointing here .
and they did .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the <unk> health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
in both cases , these are gross <unk> , because we really aren &apos;t <unk> out the problem as we should .
we have our cognitive biases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
i ordered some fluids to <unk> him and asked my colleague to <unk> him .
in this country , as many as 24,000 canadians die of preventable medical errors .
but each time , they were <unk> at me , eating at me .
in the united states , the institute of medicine <unk> it at 100,000 .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
some of my <unk> have been in the last five years .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
one i thought had a kidney stone .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
but there are two problems with that .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
and here &apos;s the thing .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a gotcha way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit .
and their pupils would dilate , they would <unk> , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , i &apos;m the trends manager at youtube , and i professionally watch youtube videos .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
last year , bear <unk> posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
three things : <unk> , communities of participation and <unk> .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
she shares her experience with others .
all right , let &apos;s go .
my name is brian goldman .
i am a redefined physician .
so how does it happen ?
oh , my god !
it &apos;s true .
<unk> , <unk> !
wooo !
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
jimmy kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
because <unk> like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
and similar to &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have just <unk> up out of nowhere .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this <unk> , geeky internet culture .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
rebecca black &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
well <unk> picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
and now there are 10,000 <unk> of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
so &quot; <unk> cat &quot; is a <unk> animation with <unk> music .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
well it was a friday , this is true .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
so what happened on this day ?
even cats were watching this video .
someone made an old <unk> version .
so what happened here ?
jimmy kimmel actually .
there were remixes .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are <unk> that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
an entire remix community <unk> up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , justin bieber , got his start on youtube .
by being totally surprising and humorous , casey <unk> got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- i &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; <unk> cat ? &quot;
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
now i work in the solar technology industry .
no one has to <unk> your idea .
it might take a moment to load .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
huh . hang on a moment .
okay . thank you very much .
and then it went international .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
what does this mean ?
what does it mean ?
this is not ...
solar technology is ...
thank you .
<unk> .
no .
okay .
and so i jumped in , i jumped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
at various points , a little letter drops down to me -- and the ipad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually addressed to me .
so back in the day , when us indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a chariot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky .
and i don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all <unk> as children .
and so when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epic &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this box belongs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch <unk> , an interactive app for the ipad .
it became a <unk> gateway into a world full of pirates and <unk> and images in my imagination .
so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
i was in the desert , under the starry skies with the sufi singer <unk> ali .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery .
and this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
so it says , &quot; place your fingers upon each light . &quot;
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a <unk> .
now we do the same with drills and machines .
i &apos;ve been illustrating books since i was 16 .
and actually i become a character in the book .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
now we do the same with airplanes .
storytelling is becoming more and more <unk> .
but what are we doing with it ?
and this made me really sad .
they stopped us from being inspired .
it can know where we are .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox today . &quot;
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
these poor <unk> have been trapped inside <unk> &apos;s chambers for thousands of years in an old and <unk> book .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that .
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
when i was a child , i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and <unk> and shells .
all along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static .
in the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
and so over here you need to tilt your ipad , take the fireflies out .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
over here , these are the <unk> .
we &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
and it opens up a map .
thank you .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
and there &apos;s nothing <unk> in the history of technology development of this kind of <unk> growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on <unk> curves .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
but when something like this happens , things are <unk> changing .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
now why do we draw technology curves in <unk> curves ?
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
one of two things is going to happen .
something really weird is going on here .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
they sort of go like this .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 <unk> of white powder , which i try not to let the security people see at airports .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were <unk> .
and at that stage , we have <unk> communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
if i had really been a <unk> , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a <unk> community .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
so what was the next step ?
and those are the neural structures .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
i &apos;m sitting here making <unk> sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
telephony , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the <unk> program right before your eyes .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess , <unk> is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that <unk> organisms have gone through -- <unk> out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started <unk> out .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
here i have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
so now we &apos;ve <unk> up the time scales once again .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
because evolution could now happen within an individual .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
it could happen in learning time scales .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their <unk> , and the children inherit the traits of the <unk> of the two programs .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the <unk> time scale .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of <unk> analogous to sex . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
say , &quot; please repeat that process . &quot;
save those . kill off the rest .
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
there are billions of them .
but they do the job .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
score them again .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into <unk> organisms .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
so we &apos;re the <unk> and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get selected out .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace corps for geeks .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the <unk> of city hall .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so confusing .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
they were there in february , and it <unk> a lot in february last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire <unk> .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
and there they make great apps , they work with city <unk> .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
we &apos;re taking off .
so meet al .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fixing it .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
and that means <unk> , it means open , it means generative .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
and this has spread just <unk> , organically , naturally .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
<unk> software usually takes a couple of years .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s spreading virally .
and that &apos;s nothing .
and that &apos;s important .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the <unk> behind the house .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about <unk> .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
he types &quot; <unk> &quot; into this official knowledge base .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
so that worked . so <unk> for scott .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
turned <unk> on its side . walked home .
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get this removed ? &quot;
<unk> ? check . living ? yep .
so scott gets this call .
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
it connected those two people .
goodnight sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , <unk> , almost a generation older than most of them .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an <unk> in it .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire <unk> all along , and many people do .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the <unk> layer on top .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being <unk> active .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we say that word with such contempt .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
so that &apos;s <unk> movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
they &apos;re using their hands .
thank you .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as <unk> , which is what the product is called , but also <unk> .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i hop on , it sends my data through google health as well .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at <unk> university is we appointed a chief listening officer .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 followers on twitter .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
we made an application for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> .
i would like to talk to you about why many <unk> projects fail .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
we know perfectly where all the atms are about the city of <unk> .
nobody knew where the nearest life-saving <unk> was to be obtained right now .
this is my wifi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
and over 10,000 <unk> already in the netherlands already have been submitted .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
but where would be the nearest <unk> to help this patient ?
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
so what we did , we <unk> the netherlands .
and i put my challenge on 95 kg .
and every morning i hop on it .
how could we help you ? &quot;
we asked around and nobody knew .
and we built an ipad application .
but there &apos;s another thing .
that whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us <unk> these <unk> .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
these might be <unk> services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the <unk> that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of <unk> .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
and despite that , it <unk> a level of <unk> .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
when i say <unk> , i mean <unk> .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
i felt like anyone could do that .
but it has an unexpected twist .
is it something about the light ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
or is it photography ?
what creates the illusion ?
thank you .
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
very quickly concrete blocks became the <unk> construction unit in the world .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
but combined , they can create something like this .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
but it does require a lot of planning .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well planned .
the shores are from a different location .
so here &apos;s another example .
thank you .
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so i decided to change that .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
instead of having to program , to wire , to <unk> , <unk> allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
you can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a <unk> brick .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
they &apos;re <unk> to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
so beyond simple play , <unk> are actually pretty powerful .
<unk> are electronic modules with each one specific function .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
a few years ago i started developing <unk> .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
let me show you how they work .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
lego made it accessible .
the bricks are color-coded .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
for example , how a <unk> works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with <unk> as a material .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have <unk> making ...
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a <unk> <unk> <unk> ball .
like here , we have mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of kiev in ukraine .
to these <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics became just another material .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
we &apos;ve been giving <unk> to kids and seeing them play with them .
it &apos;s a <unk> made of <unk> that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
we &apos;ve also been taking <unk> to design schools .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
we would never do that in our own countries .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
so go ahead and start inventing .
this is happening to us today .
we have three main groups .
so <unk> is open-source .
we have online criminals .
thank you .
groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has <unk> , <unk> encrypted services , services like gmail .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
we actually have several cases of millionaires online , <unk> , who made money with their attacks .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
<unk> is a certificate authority from the netherlands -- or actually , it was .
this is matthew anderson , tariq <unk> and so on and so on .
mr. jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
they had sold this tool for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
and then we look at cases like what happened in <unk> .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of <unk> .
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; <unk> . &quot;
except they can if they hack into a foreign c.a.
here &apos;s vladimir <unk> form <unk> in estonia .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
what do you do with certificates ?
and his answer was yes .
these guys make money .
this is alfred <unk> .
this is stephen watt .
this is bjorn <unk> .
well <unk> is a c.a.
and issue rogue certificates .
they sell certificates .
thế là sau bốn năm , một trường thiên đằng đẵng hơn cả trong truyện , một chiếc thuyền <unk> ra biển nguỵ trang là thuyền đánh cá .
và những mảnh tiếng anh đứt quãng trong cuộc hội thoại giữa những con người có duy một điểm chung , họ đang bắt đầu lại từ đầu .
với mẹ , cuộc đời cô đọng vào nhiệm vụ duy nhất : để gia đình mẹ trốn thoát và bắt đầu cuộc sống mới ở úc .
hãy tưởng tượng ông , một người cộng sản tiến vào sài gòn , đối diện sự thật rằng cả cuộc đời ông đã phí hoài .
và mảnh ghép tiếp theo của bức tranh là về bốn người phụ nữ , ba thế hệ cùng nhau định hình cuộc sống mới .
chúng tôi định cư ở <unk> , vùng ngoại ô cho dân lao động trong đó dân số là các tầng lớp người nhập cư .
mẹ tôi làm việc trong trang trại , rồi trong dây chuyền sản xuất ô tô , làm việc tuần sáu ngày , hai ca .
ngôn từ , qua bao năm tháng là bạn đồng hành với ông , giờ quay ra chế giễu ông .
mảnh ghép tiếp theo của tấm hình là một con thuyền trong sớm hoàng hôn lặng lẽ <unk> ra biển .
nếu chúng tôi bị bắt , đầu tiên là em tôi và tôi , rồi mẹ và bà sẽ uống .
hãy tưởng tượng mảnh đầu tiên : một người đàn ông đốt cháy sự nghiệp cả đời mình .
thế mà mẹ vẫn kiếm ra thời gian học tiếng anh và lấy bằng công nghệ thông tin .
như hầu hết người lớn trên thuyền , mẹ tôi mang theo một chai thuốc độc nhỏ .
nỗi sợ hãi lớn nhất là cướp biển , nạn cưỡng hiếp , và cái chết .
sau ba tháng trong trại tị nạn tập trung , chúng tôi đặt chân tới melbourne .
hai đôi tất để đi học , mỗi đôi để che lỗ thủng trên đôi kia .
một bộ đồng phục dài tới mắt cá , vì phải dành mặc đến sáu năm .
nhưng cuộc đời ta nhiều hơn những gì ta lưu trong kí ức nhiều .
bà tôi chưa bao giờ cho phép tôi quên cuộc đời của ông .
mẹ không bao giờ chấp nhận được là mẹ sẽ không thành công .
hãy để tôi kể cho các bạn về vài mảnh ghép nhé .
nó là một trò chơi ghép hình vẫn đang được xếp .
tất cả những người lớn đều biết các rủi ro .
mùi từ các cửa hàng đến từ khắp thế giới .
ông qua đời , bị lịch sử quật ngã .
không có quả táo nào ngon được đến thế .
tôi chưa bao giờ gặp ông ngoài đời .
câu chuyện này chưa kết thúc .
ông rút lui vào yên lặng .
ông là ông của tôi .
chúng tôi rất nghèo .
về nhà ở đâu ?
trong thế giới kia , tôi vướng mắc trong những mảnh đời bấp bênh , bị tổn thương bi thảm vì bạo lực , nghiện ngập và cô quạnh .
tôi gặp những người từ mọi tầng lớp xã hội , rất nhiều người đang làm việc họ yêu thích , sống tại ranh giới của cơ hội .
có một nguồn năng lượng ngoài đó , một niềm lạc quan khôn nguôi , một sự pha trộn kì lạ của sự khiêm nhường và liều lĩnh .
mẹ tôi tối nào cũng kiệt sức , nhưng chúng tôi kể cho nhau nghe chuyện trong ngày và nghe tiếng bà tôi đi lại quanh nhà .
tôi thu thập được một đội nhỏ với chúng tôi cái tựa &quot; không làm được đâu &quot; là một thử thách hấp dẫn không cưỡng được .
và vì công tác đó , khi tôi là sinh viên luật năm cuối , tôi được bầu là thanh niên úc của năm .
niềm quyết tâm tụ lại và một giọng lặng lẽ nói , &quot; tôi sẽ đi vòng qua mọi trở ngại . &quot;
mẹ mở cửa hàng máy tính rồi học nghề chuyên viên thẩm mĩ và mở một cơ sở kinh doanh khác .
trong một thế giới , tôi là học sinh gốc á điển hình , đòi hỏi khắc nghiệt từ chính mình .
và tôi bị phóng từ mảnh ghép xếp hình này sang mảnh khác , nhưng chúng không ghép vừa với nhau .
nhiệm vụ của tôi là thức đến khi mẹ bị ác mộng hành hạ để gọi mẹ dậy .
&quot; cứ làm đi , &quot; mẹ nói , &quot; và đừng cố trở thành người khác . &quot;
và dù tôi tốt nghiệp , tội nhận ra rằng tôi không thể yên phận trong nghề luật .
mẹ nhắc tôi là bấy giờ tôi cũng bằng tuổi mẹ khi chúng tôi lên thuyền .
những khả năng mà trước đây sẽ không được cho phép được khuyến khích rất nhiều .
mẹ tôi , em gái và tôi ngủ chung trên một chiếc giường .
và tôi càng nói thật lòng , tôi càng được mời nói nhiều .
chúng tôi kiếm tìm trợ cấp và những nhà tài trợ .
nhưng qua năm tháng rất nhiều em đã được giúp đỡ .
nói &apos; không &apos; chưa bao giờ là một lựa chọn .
trong suốt một năm chúng tôi không một xu dính túi .
mẹ tôi bị bao nhiêu ác mộng về chiếc thuyền .
tôi bảo mẹ là tôi không thể làm được .
thế nên tôi đi theo linh cảm của mình .
tôi sống trong hai thế giới song song .
tôi không biết nói về cái gì hết .
có chút gì cứng lại trong tôi .
tôi không biết cách dùng thìa dĩa .
tôi không biết nói chuyện về rượu .
bức xếp hình cần một mảnh nữa .
các trung tâm được thành lập .
tôi không biết các qui trình .
hầu hết ý tưởng của chúng tôi đều điên khùng , nhưng vài ý tưởng vô cùng tuyệt vời , và chúng tôi tạo ra đột phá .
bà lớn lên trong thời kì mà đạo khổng là chuẩn mực xã hội và quan lại địa phương có quyền sinh quyền sát .
nhưng nếu tôi có thể cho điều đó và vẫn thấy con tôi yên bình vượt qua , tôi sẽ cho con tôi .
năm 17 tuổi , bà trở thành vợ hai của một ông quan , mẫu thân ông quan này đánh đập bà .
tôi đang tắm trong một phòng khách sạn ở sydney vào thời khắc bà mất cách đó 600 dặm , ở melbourne .
vài ngày sau , chúng tôi đến một ngôi chùa đạo phật ở <unk> và ngồi quanh quan tài của bà .
mẹ tôi hỏi nhà sư , &quot; tại sao tay mẹ tôi ấm thế mà cả người lại lạnh ngắt ? &quot;
nếu có một nguồn lực trong gia đình chúng tôi , nguồn ấy truyền qua những người phụ nữ .
chúng tôi kể chuyện cho bà và cam đoan với bà là chúng tôi luôn ở bên bà .
lúc nửa đêm một nhà sư đến và bảo chúng tôi là ông phải đóng quan tài rồi .
nhưng tôi sợ đặc quyền đặc lợi , sợ cuộc sống thoải mái , sợ quyền sở hữu .
trước khi tôi kết thúc , hãy đế tôi kể cho các bạn về bà tôi .
hết ngày , tôi làm một nồi súp khổng lồ để chúng tôi cùng ăn .
&quot; bởi vì từ sàng các chị đã cầm tay bà , &quot; ông nói .
giờ đây tôi cũng muốn có con , và tôi băn khoăn về con thuyền .
ba tháng sau tôi chuyển địa điểm và chuyến phiêu lưu lại tiếp diễn .
tôi nhìn qua tấm kính cửa và thấy bà đứng ở bên kia
có ai muốn con của họ phải trải qua con thuyền ấy ?
cuộc sống đã là như vậy trong hàng thế kỷ rồi .
&quot; không làm được đâu &quot; bị chứng minh là sai .
ba của bà mất ngay sau khi bà ra đời .
tôi biết bà đã đến để tạm biệt tôi .
mẹ bảo chúng tôi cảm nhận tay bà tôi .
mẹ của bà một mình nuôi bà lớn .
&quot; các chị không hề buông tay . &quot;
thất bại sẽ đến một cách dễ dàng .
chúng tôi làm việc đến đêm khuya .
vài phút sau mẹ tôi gọi điện .
tôi quyết định chuyển tới nước mỹ
sau có một chuyến đi .
lại là linh cảm .
tôi không biết .
tôi đã phải trải qua thời gian dài trong tù , sau song sắt và cả trong nhà tù dành cho người bị kết án tử hình .
và tôi đến đây tôi lại được khuyến khích và rồi tôi lắng nghe chính điều này đã tiếp thêm nghị lực cho tôi rất nhiều
bà nói : &quot; nào , hãy chắc chắn là con sẽ không làm thế chứ &quot; . tôi nói &quot; chắc chắn ạ &quot;
rồi bà ngồi xuống , nhìn tôi và nói &quot; bà muốn con biết rằng bà vẫn luôn theo chân đến con &quot; .
thỉnh thoảng , tôi đến và ở bên bà nhưng thật khó để bà có thời gian quan tâm đến tôi .
thực ra tôi không học được điều này khi tôi hành nghề luật sư hay qua những công việc tôi làm
và vâng , mẹ của chị tan hôm nay cũng ở đây ở hàng ghế thứ tư hay năm .
và các bạn có thể nói về rất nhiều điều có ảnh hưởng trên toàn thế giới tại đây .
khi tôi còn bé , mỗi khi tôi nhìn bà bà sẽ đến bên và ôm tôi vào lòng
thật là vinh hạnh cho tôi khi được đứng đây và cùng chia sẻ với mọi người
và tôi đề cập đến điều này bởi tôi nghĩ bản sắc thực sự rất quan trọng
đó là lý do tại sao tôi muốn nói về sức mạnh của bản sắc nhân cách
bà ôm tôi chặt đến mức tôi thấy khó thở rồi sau đó bà để tôi đi
cha mẹ bà sinh ra trong thời kỳ nô lệ tại virginia vào những năm 1840
tôi nhớ như in ngày đó , tưởng chừng như mới xảy qua hôm qua vậy
thế rồi tôi nhìn bà và cười nhưng bà có vẻ rất nghiêm trọng .
bà rất cứng rắn , mạnh mẽ và đầy quyền lực trong gia đình
và cũng luôn là người khơi nên nhiều cuộc tranh cãi trong gia đình
bà sỡ hữu một tính cách mà bạn sẽ luôn muốn ở gần .
bà luôn là người chấm dứt mọi trận cãi vã trong gia đình
các anh chị em họ của tôi cứ xung quanh bà mọi nơi
mà tôi thực sự học được điều này từ bà của mình
ba mẹ bà thực ra là người con của nô lệ .
thách thức duy nhất là bà có đến 10 đứa con .
bà tôi thì đang ngồi đối diện nhìn tôi chằm chằm .
lúc đầu , tôi tưởng chúng tôi đang chơi một trò chơi
chúng ta đã có vài bài diễn thuyết rất tuyệt vời
&quot; bà nghĩ con là đứa trẻ đặc biệt &quot;
bà cứng rắn , nhưng cũng đắm <unk> .
và tôi sẽ không bao giờ quên được .
mẹ tôi là con út trong nhà ,
tôi đáp &quot; dạ được thôi ạ &quot;
anh ấy nhìn tôi khó chịu , &quot; ồ , anh mong em sẽ không bận tâm quá nhiều về buổi nói chuyện đó của bà ngoại và em &quot;
tôi lớn lên ở vùng quê miền nam và có một anh trai , lớn hơn tôi một tuổi và một em gái , nhỏ hơn tôi một tuổi
tôi nói &quot; không , không , <unk> không sao . hai người cứ uống đi . em sẽ không uống một giọt bia nào cả &quot;
tuy nhiên tôi vẫn sẽ nói , tôi đã 52 tuổi và tôi xin thừa nhận rằng tôi chưa từng uống một giọt rượu nào
&quot; điều thứ 2 bà muốn con hứa là sẽ luôn làm những việc đúng đắn dẫu có khó khăn đến mấy &quot; .
cuối cùng bà nói &quot; điều thứ 3 là con hãy hứa với bà rằng con sẽ không bao giờ uống rượu &quot; .
tôi nói &quot; không , em không cảm thấy như thế là đúng . hai người cứ uống đi , cứ tiếp tục &quot;
&quot; nó là đứa con gái bé bỏng của bà , con hãy hứa rằng sẽ luôn chăm sóc mẹ con nhé &quot;
anh đã uống một ít , em gái em cũng đã uống một ít , nào tới lượt em uống đấy &quot;
mỗi khi nghĩ về bà ngoại tất nhiên tôi biết bà cho rằng tất cả những đứa cháu đều đặc biệt .
anh ấy uống xong một ngụm bia thì đưa cho tôi và em gái và họ đưa bia cho tôi .
chúng ta có thể khiến họ bắt tay vào làm những việc mà họ không nghĩ rằng họ làm được .
à , tôi yêu mẹ , vì thế tôi hứa ngay &quot; vâng , con sẽ làm ạ &quot;
à , lúc đó tôi mới 9 tuổi nên tôi nói &quot; vâng , con hứa ạ &quot;
rồi bà nói tiếp &quot; con chỉ cần hứa với bà 3 điều , bryan à &quot;
&quot; điều đầu tiên bà muốn con hứa là con phải luôn yêu thương mẹ con &quot;
anh trả lời &quot; bà nói với tất cả những đứa cháu rằng chúng đặc biệt &quot;
ông ngoại tôi đã ở tù suốt thời kỳ cấm nấu và bán rượu ,
và tất nhiên bà nghĩ có những điều chúng ta cần phải cam kết .
đại loại là chúng tôi đã ở ngoài đó làm những thứ điên cuồng
&quot; bà nghĩ con có thể làm mọi thứ mà con muốn &quot;
tôi suy nghĩ rồi nói &quot; vâng , con sẽ làm ạ &quot;
và nói &quot; em bị làm sao vậy ? uống tí đi &quot;
tôi biết rằng buổi nói chuyện này sẽ được phát sóng rộng rãi
tôi nói &quot; anh đang nói gì thế ? &quot;
cậu tôi chết vì bệnh do rượu gây ra .
tôi sẽ không bao giờ quên lời bà .
tôi muốn thú nhận với các bạn một điều
và rồi anh tôi nhìn tôi chằm chằm
mà đáng lý tôi không nên nói ra
tôi nói &quot; dạ được ạ &quot;
lúc đấy , tôi thấy thất vọng
cứ 3 người đàn ông da đen ở độ tuổi từ 18 đến 30 thì có một người đang trong tù , bị quản chế hoặc được tạm tha .
tôi sống ở bang alabama , cũng giống như những bang khác sẽ thực sự tước quyền bầu cử của bạn mãi mãi nếu bạn phạm tội hình sự
cách nghĩ khác về điều này không phải là liệu người có tội có đáng chết hay không mà liệu chúng ta có quyền giết họ hay không ?
chúng tôi dự đoán rằng thêm 10 năm nữa mức độ tước quyền công dân sẽ lại nặng như trước khi đạo luật bầu cử được thông qua
đối với những người nghèo , người da màu hệ luỵ của việc này đã khiến họ phải sống với nỗi thất vọng tràn trề .
nỗi sợ hãi lẫn và giận dữ chính trị đã khiến chúng ta tin rằng đây không phải và vấn đề mà chúng ta phải lo
chính sự giàu có , chứ không phải là có tội hay không có tội ảnh hưởng đến kết quả .
ngay hiện nay , ở bang alabama có 34 % đàn ông da đen bị vĩnh viễn mất quyền bầu cử
mỹ là quốc gia duy nhất trên thế giới kết án đứa trẻ 13 tuổi tù chung thân .
quốc gia chúng ta , nó đã khác đi rất nhiều so với 40 năm về trước .
theo tôi , sự phạt tù rộng rãi như thế đã cơ bản thay đổi thế giới này
nhưng vẫn có cách nghĩ khác về chúng ta đang ở đâu trong nhân cách của mình .
chúng ta đang chứng kiến vài sự phát triển rất thú vị trong việc làm của mình
tôi thì đã và đang cố nói ra đôi điều về hệ thống tư pháp của
mặc dù vậy , chúng ta dường như vẫn thấy thoải mái về điều này
nước mỹ giờ đây có tỉ lệ phạt tù cao nhất trên thế giới
chúng ta có án tù chung thân không hề đặc xá cho trẻ em
chúng ta thực ra còn đang thực hiện những vụ kiện tụng trẻ em
câu hỏi về án tử hình được đặt ra này rất thú vị .
án tử hình tại mỹ được xác định một cách không chính xác
và có 7 triệu người bị quản chế hoặc được tạm tha
và là nước duy nhất trên thế giới làm điều này .
tôi xin lên tiếng làm đại diện cho những người tử tù
ngày nay , con số đó đã lên đến 2,3 triệu
tôi muốn đại diện lên tiếng nói cho trẻ em .
rất nhiều khác hàng của tôi vẫn còn rất nhỏ
năm 1972 , đã có 300.000 người bị tù
nhưng điều này lại khiến tôi quan tâm
và có một sự im lặng đáng trách
đây là một câu hỏi rất hợp lý
ý tôi là , thật khó tin !
thế là chúng ta tách biệt
và điều thú vị là khi tôi dạy học sinh của mình về lịch sử của người mỹ gốc phi tôi kể với họ về chế độ nô lệ ,
trong ngành hàng không , chúng ta sẽ không bao giờ để mọi người đi nếu cứ mỗi 9 máy bay cất cánh mà có một chiếc bị rơi
ở nam phi , người ta biết rằng họ không thể chống chọi với chế độ apartheid nếu họ không cam kết với sự thật và làm hoà
cứ 9 người bị kết án tử chúng tôi tìm thấy một người vô tội được giải tội và thả khỏi tử tù
khủng bố - thời kỳ này bắt đầu từ cuối công cuộc tái thiết và kéo dài cho đến thế chiến thứ ii
việc làm đó thật vô lương tâm dù vô tình hay cố ý cũng không nên tử hình ai đó &quot;
đây là tỉ lệ kết án sai khủng khiếp 1 trong 9 người bị kết án là người vô tội
chúng ta thấy được thực trạng này nhưng chúng ta lại không muốn bàn về vấn đề của chính mình
nhưng đối với người mỹ gốc phi ở quốc gia này đó là một thời kỳ khủng khiếp .
và vì thế , chúng ta đã chẳng hiểu được điều đó có ý nghĩa như thế nào
và tất nhiên , chúng tôi sẽ không bao giờ có hình phạt tử hình ở đức &quot;
về chủng tộc và về câu hỏi liệu chúng ta có xứng đáng giết họ .
và chính mối đe doạ của khủng bố định hình nên cuộc sống của họ .
mà hãy nói với họ rằng chúng tôi đã phải lớn lên cùng với điều đó
nhưng bằng cách nào đó , chúng ta lại tách mình khỏi vấn đề này
cũng không phải điều mà chúng ta cần đấu tranh , nỗ lực .
tôi đã có vài bài diễn thuyết ở đức về mức án tử hình
xem đó không phải là vấn đề của chúng ta ,
chúng ta thực sự không biết nhiều về điều này
nhiều cộng đồng đã lo sợ bị hành hình ,
tôi nói rất nhiều về những vấn đề này
không ngừng gây ra căng thẳng và bất hoà
&quot; ở đức không có mức án tử hình
chúng ta không muốn nói về lịch sử
và vì thế , có sự ngăn cách
thật sự khó mà tưởng tượng nỗi
không phải gánh nặng của chúng ta
tôi không thể làm ngơ được .
họ lo sợ bị ném bom
chúng ta không ngừng mâu thuẫn
và tôi nghĩ về điều này
như thế quá vô lương tâm
nhưng cuối cùng , thực tế này vẫn bị che khuất bởi nỗi thống khổ , sự lạm dụng , thoái hoá đạo đức và xem nhẹ nhân cách .
các bạn biết đó , cuối cùng thì chúng ta cũng phải tin vào những gì mà chúng ta chưa từng tận mắt chứng kiến
khi chúng ta không thực sự quan tâm đến những thứ khó khăn thì những điều tốt đẹp tuyệt nhiên cũng bị ảnh hưởng
thực sự , định hướng là điều cốt lõi trong niềm tin của tôi mà thậm chí công đồng ted cũng như vậy .
tôi có được một đặc ân rất lớn , khi tôi còn là một luật sư non nớt , tôi đã gặp rosa park
đổi mới , sáng tạo , và phát triển có được không đơn thuần chỉ từ ý tưởng trong đầu chúng ta
tuy nhiên , hãy suy nghĩ về họ theo cách hoà nhập với cả cuộc sống của chính chúng ta .
cố gắng đương đầu với sự thiên vị và phân biệt xử trong cách xét xử tư pháp ,
cố gắng chấm dứt cảnh trẻ em bị kết án chung thân mà không hề được đặc xá ,
mà chúng xuất phát từ những ý tưởng rồi được tiếp sức bằng niềm tin của trái tim
vaclav <unk> , một vị lãnh tụ vĩ đại của séc , đã nói về điều này .
còn đối với tôi , việc kết hợp cả hai điều trên là thực sự cần thiết
bà ấy hỏi &quot; vậy cậu dự định sẽ làm gì khi đến đây ? &quot;
vâng . chúng ta có lý , chúng ta cống hiến cho trí tuệ .
việc này thực sự đã tiếp thêm nghị lực cho tôi rất nhiều
&quot; à , chúng tôi đang cố thay đổi sự bất công .
chúng tôi đang cố gắng giúp những người bị kết án oan ,
tôi cho rằng nhân cách của chúng ta đang bị mai một
và rồi tôi đến đó , và tôi sẽ chỉ lắng nghe
cố gắng làm được việc gì đó về án tử hình ,
và tôi trả lời &quot; vâng , tôi sẽ đến &quot;
những người phụ <unk> này chỉ đến và nói chuyện
và chấm dứt việc bắt giam diện rộng &quot; .
và những gì cậu đang cố thực hiện &quot;
cậu có muốn đến nghe không ? &quot;
tôi nói &quot; tôi sẽ lắng nghe &quot;
thế là tôi bắt đầu nói huyên thuyên
giảm thiểu số người bị bỏ tù ,
yêu công nghệ , thích sáng tạo
đến những điều vừa nêu .
chúng ta thích cải tiến
thích giải trí
còn có một dòng rất điên rồ về việc làm thế nào mà không hề có sự đúng đắn trên đất nước này tất cả đều sai trái .
tôi trình bày trong đơn kiến nghị rằng đã có sự nhầm lẫn trong công tố , hành vi sai trái của cảnh sát và tư pháp .
sáng hôm sau , tôi thức dậy và nghĩ , tôi đã mơ về một bản kiến nghị điên rồ hay tôi thực sự đã viết nó ?
chúng ta cần tìm cách để đối đầu với những thách thức , những vấn đề và cả nỗi khổ mà sự bất công gây ra
và vì tôi thức quá khuya , mà không suy nghĩ một cách hệ thống thế là tôi bắt đầu viết ra một bản kiến nghị
nếu ai lấy một món đồ gì mà không thuộc quyền sở hữu của họ , họ không chỉ là một tên trộm .
bởi vì đó là hệ quả của việc chúng ta bắt đầu có cái nhìn sâu sắc về chúng ta là ai .
thỉnh thoảng những ý tưởng này cứ liên tục xuất hiện trong suy nghĩ của chúng ta rằng chúng rất quan trọng .
tôi cho rằng , thâm chí khi bạn giết ai đó , bạn cũng không hẳn là một kẻ sát nhân .
quan toà chứng nhận đó là một người trưởng thành , nhưng tôi thấy cậu ấy vẫn còn là một đứa trẻ
trong cơn hoảng loạn , không những tôi đã viết nó , mà tôi cũng đã gửi nó đến toà án .
khi tôi nói hết ý của mình , bà ấy nhìn tôi và nói &quot; ừm , ừm , ừm &quot;
bởi vì xét cho cùng , tất cả chúng ta phụ thuộc từng cá nhân sống trên hành tinh này .
và tôi dần hiểu và tin rằng mỗi chúng ta phải hơn điều tệ nhất mà chúng ta từng làm .
thi thoảng , khi tôi mất cân bằng , tôi sẽ kết thúc tình trạng ấy bằng câu chuyện này .
và vì thế , con người chúng ta có phẩm giá cơ bản phải được luật pháp bảo vệ .
tôi cho rằng nếu ai đó nói dối , họ không đơn thuần là kẻ dối trá .
tôi thực sự nghĩ rằng ở rất nhiều nơi đối nghịch với cái nghèo là sự công bằng
tôi bắt đầu suy nghĩ , làm sao mà chuyện này có thể xảy ra được ?
sao một quan toà có thể biến bạn thành một người mà bạn vốn không phải ?
rằng tôi có một thân chủ mới 14 tuổi , là người da đen và nghèo khó
&quot; việc đó sẽ khiến cậu mệt mỏi , mệt mỏi , và mệt mỏi &quot;
tôi đã học được những điều rất đơn giản khi làm công việc của mình .
và tôi đã làm đại diện cho những đứa trẻ bị kết án rất nặng .
tôi thực sự cho rằng cộng đồng ted cần phải dũng cảm hơn .
tôi tin điều đó đúng với mọi người trên trái đất này .
tôi thật sự rất mệt , cũng giống như mọi người thôi .
vâng , bryan , quan toà có quyền lực như thế ,
nó chỉ dạy tôi những điều rất đơn giản .
thế thì mình nên xin họ một chút .
thỉnh thoảng khi tôi cố quá sức ,
tôi không tin như thế .
và khi tôi bước lên bậc thang của toà án có một người đàn ông da đen lớn tuổi hơn tôi , ông là người trông nom toà án .
tôi nói , &quot; cháu là luật sư &quot; . ông ấy nói : &quot; cậu là luật sư ? &quot; , tôi nói &quot; dạ đúng rồi &quot; .
biết rằng chúng ta không thể làm con người thực sự đến khi nào chúng ta quan tâm đến nhân quyền và nhân phẩm .
trong lúc giải lao , phó quận trưởng cảnh sát thấy bị xúc phạm vì người canh gác bước vào phòng xử án .
khi người đàn ông này thấy tôi , ông tiến về phía tôi và nói : &quot; cậu là ai ? &quot;
ông nói : &quot; anh <unk> , có phải chính anh đã viết đơn kiến nghị điên rồ này không ? &quot;
và dù không đứng trước mắt tôi , nhưng tôi vẫn có thể nhìn thấy người canh giữ bước tới bước lui
ông luôn nhìn vào qua cánh cửa sổ , và ông có thể nghe hết tất cả những tiếng la hét .
rằng sự tồn tại của tất cả chúng ta gắn bó mật thiết với sự tồn tài của từng người .
tôi trả lời : &quot; vâng , thưa ngài &quot; . và rồi chúng tôi bắt đầu tranh luận .
và cuối cùng tôi quyết định tôi sẽ đến toà án và nhận vụ án khó khăn này .
và tôi phải nói với các bạn rằng điều đó khiến cho tôi tràn đầy nghị lực .
ông bước vào phòng và ngồi phía sau tôi , rất gần bàn luật sư .
thay vì chỉ biết quyên góp tiền , chúng tôi có thể giúp được gì ?
tôi bước vào xe , trong lòng cảm thấy rất rất choáng ngợp .
và cuối cùng tôi cũng bước ra khỏi xe , tiến vào toà án
vài tháng trôi qua , tôi dường như quên hẳn chuyện này .
lúc đấy tôi nghĩ chuyện này sẽ khó khăn gian khổ đây .
mọi người bắt đầu vào phòng vì họ đang rất giận dữ .
khoảng 10 phút sau khi quan toà tuyên bố nghỉ giải lao .
và nói : &quot; jimmy , ông làm gì trong đây ? &quot;
và khi tôi bước vào , thẩm phán nhìn thấy tôi đến
trợ lý công tố viên và các thư ký bước vào .
và ông ấy tiến lại gần hơn và ôm lấy tôi
ông nói : &quot; tôi rất tự hào về cậu &quot;
chính tôi đã viết những điều điên rồ này .
ông ta nhảy nhổm lên tiến đến người canh gác
tôi vào xe và rồi đến toà án .
ông cứ đi tới đi lui .
cảm ơn các bạn rất nhiều .
thì thầm vào tai tôi ,
tôi đến phòng xử án ,
ví dụ tại <unk> chúng tôi sẽ chi 1 triệu đô la cho án phạt tử hình trong 5 năm tới . vâng , 1 triệu đô la .
và đợt trưng cầu dân ý này sẽ đưa ra kiến nghị để có tiền để thi hành và đảm bảo tính công bằng của luật pháp .
câu chuyện này. chúng ta đã nghe rất nhiều lần về galapagos và những nơi khác. vậy nên chẳng có gì đặc biệt về nó hết .
tôi nghĩ triết lý hình phạt hiện tại của chúng ta thật vô ích , chẳng giúp được gì cho ai cả .
tỉ lệ bị bắt giam ở nước mỹ tăng mạnh thực ra không phải tội phạm bạo lực .
một ngành ngư nghiệp quy mô lớn đang khai thác loại cá này cho đến thập niên 80 .
và một phần của câu chuyện đó là đôi khi là do tăng thời gian giam giữ .
và chúng ta đã mất đi sự kiểm soát đối với mặt trái của các hình phạt .
thực chất là tỉ lệ phạm tội bạo lực vẫn ở mức tương đối ổn định .
rất cảm ơn anh đã đến với ted . một lần nữa xin cảm ơn anh .
câu chuyện thứ nhất là về charles darwin , một trong những vị anh hùng của tôi
và bạn nghĩ rằng ông đến để đuổi bắt sẻ núi , nhưng không phải thế .
vì thế , chúng ta có một cơ hội để thay đổi tình hình này .
bryan , anh thực sự đã đánh đúng tâm lý của mọi người ở đây .
tội phạm ở mỹ đã giảm đi rất nhiều suốt 3 thập niên qua .
và số lượng người bị bắt giam đã tăng lên rất đáng kể .
tôi cho rằng đó là điều mà chúng ta cần phải thay đổi .
ông đã đến đây trong những năm <unk> như các bạn biết khá rõ
hiện tại loại cá này đang nằm trong danh sách đỏ của iucn .
ông miêu tả một trong số chúng là rất &quot; thông thường &quot;
à , luôn có nhiều cơ hội xung quanh chúng ta .
và tôi nghĩ rằng cơ hội luôn ở quanh chúng ta .
bạn sẽ nói gì với những ai tin vào chuyện này ?
mà đây chính là một cuộc chiến chống lại ma tuý .
và 46 % vụ án giết người không bị bắt .
56 % vụ án hiếp dâm không được xử lý .
nhưng điểm chính là , chúng ta vẫn đến galapagos .
anh thực sự là một người truyền cảm hứng .
tôi sẽ nói về một ý tưởng nho nhỏ
thực ra ông thu thập các loại cá .
về sự dịch chuyển của đường mốc giới
đây là con cá mú vây buồm .
tôi dùng nó để làm các cuộc khảo sát xuyên suốt vùng phía nam của biển nam hải trung quốc và đặc biệt vùng biển java .
câu chuyện thứ hai , vẫn là để chú giải cho một khái niệm khác cái được gọi là sự dịch chuyển của đường hông .
tôi đến đó vì tôi đã lớn lên ở châu âu và đã mong muốn rằng sau này sẽ được làm việc tại châu phi
có cả cá rô phi khoảng chừng 20 cm một loài cá rô phi được với với cái tên là cá rô phi cằm đen
trong những năm <unk> , à không , bắt đầu từ những năm <unk> châu âu thực hiện rất nhiều các dự án phát triển
đáy biển bị biến dạng trong trường hợp này từ đáy biển cứng hoặc san hô mềm trở thành một đống bùn hỗn độn .
90 % cái mà chúng tôi đánh bắt được là bọt biển , và những sinh vật khác sống chặt dưới đáy biển
điều chính yếu là những thứ dưới đáy biển được kéo lên thuyền sau đó lại bị vứt ngược trở lại .
trong vòng 1 năm , bạn làm một cuộc khảo sát sau đó ngành đánh bắt cá thương mại bắt đầu .
tôi có làn da rám nắng tôi đã bị thuyết phục là mình thực sự không đến từ đó
27 năm sau khi tôi trở lại , kích cỡ của loại cá này chỉ còn phân nửa .
những tấm hình này thật quá sứ tưởng tượng vì sự chuyển dịch này diễn ra quá nhanh chóng
những loài như thế này chúng không được tiêu thụ , chúng bị quẳng đi vì chúng đã chết
đầm phá được bao quanh bởi cây cọ bạn có thể thấy , một vài cây đước .
cái mà chúng tôi bắt được , hiện tại tôi đã biết được rằng đó là đáy biển
cái mà chúng tôi bắt được , chúng tôi không tìm được từ giải nghĩa cho nó
cười tôi đã đến đó vào năm 1971 , nghiên cứu đầm phá ở tây phi
thế nên chẳng có gì thay đổi cả , nhưng mọi thứ đã biến đổi .
những tờ rơi quảng cáo vẫn đang thông tin rằng chúng chưa bị chạm đến
và cái thuyền này đây , khá xấu , được gọi là <unk> 4 .
và những loại cá này dường như cũng thoải mái khi ở đó .
mặc dù tôi đã có thể hoà nhập với cuộc sống tại đó
đã có một sự tác động về gen lên trên loại cá này
chúng đạt đến độ tuổi trưởng thành tại kích cỡ <unk>
một lần chúng tôi bắt được một con còn sống .
vậy thì điều gì xảy ra tại đây ?
đây là vết rám nắng đầu tiên của tôi
chúng ta vẫn nghĩ nó còn nguyên sơ
đây là một con rùa biển đã chết
chúng vẫn rất yên ổn .
còn có rất nhiều cá
nó vẫn chưa bị <unk>
thế còn những người không thể làm thế được thì sao ? vì họ không có cách tiếp <unk> những người ở vùng trung tây chẳng hạn ?
chúng ta điều chỉnh đường mốc giới của chính mình lên một cấp độ mới mà chúng ta chẳng nhớ trước kia nó như thế nào .
vì , hiển nhiên , một loài động vật với số lượng rất phong phú , trước khi nó bị tuyệt chủng nó trở nên quý hiếm
theo thời gian chúng ta tập trung vào những động vật lớn ở biển , chúng ta tập trung vào những con cá lớn
thực ra , rất nhiều người , và các nhà khoa học sẽ bàn cãi rằng trước kia nó thật sự rất khác .
theo thời gian nó sẽ thay đổi-- nó thay đổi do con người làm điều gì đó tác động hay do tự nhiên
tôi nghĩ là những môn nghệ thuật và phim ảnh có lẽ có thể bù đắp được , và sự mô phỏng .
chúng ta muốn duy trì những thứ đã không còn nữa hay những thứ mà không còn giống như trước kia nữa
và điều đó , với mức độ rộng lớn hơn , là cái chúng ta muốn làm hiện nay .
theo thời gian chúng ta chỉ còn rất ít cá và chúng ta nghĩ đây là đường mốc giới .
vì với những vùng biển được bảo tồn như thế chúng ta thực sự đang tái tạo lại quá khứ
các bạn sẽ có lẽ để ý thấy màu sắc và âm điệu giống như phim &quot; avatar . &quot;
nếu bạn khái quát hoá điều này , điều gì đó giống như thế này sẽ xảy đến
và như thế , vai trò to lớn mà vùng biển được bảo tồn có thể đóng góp
nhưng họ không nhận thức được cái xảy đến trước đó như là một sự mất mát
sự khác biệt sau đó là họ nhận thức đó như là một sự mất mát
câu hỏi được đặt ra là , sao mọi người lại chấp nhận điều này ?
rất lâu trước đây ở vịnh <unk> có loại cá voi xám 500 năm trước .
vì nó khơi mào cho điều gì đó thuộc về cảm giác đã bị mất .
chính vì vậy chúng không được coi như là một sự mất mát to lớn
chúng trở nên ngày càng khan hiếm hơn vì bị chúng ta đánh bắt chúng
bạn có biết bạn thực hiện bao nhiêu sự lựa chọn trong 1 ngày ?
chúng ta biến đổi thế giới nhưng chúng ta lại không nhớ điều này
vậy nên bạn không mất đi những động vật với số lượng phong phú
bạn có thể thực hiện hàng loạt những sự thay đổi nối tiếp
thế là họ muốn giết nó vì thịt nó ăn rất ngon
nhưng điều này không được ghi nhận lại bằng tài liệu .
cuối cùng bạn muốn duy trì những thứ nghèo nàn còn lại
chì vì họ không biết trước đây nó khác biệt
bạn chỉ mất đi những động vật quý hiếm
đây là sự mô phỏng của vịnh <unk> .
cám ơn rất nhiều
cho nên khi tôi hỏi bạn 1 câu hỏi cho là tôi không nhìn thấy gì , nếu bạn muốn đốt 1 lượng calo , chỉ cần giơ tay cao
tôi đã từng rất thích vào cửa hàng này , nhưng tự nhiên , tôi đã từng tự hỏi mình làm sao bạn đến và không mua thứ gì ?
và khi tôi nó về vấn đề này , tôi sẽ có vài câu hỏi cho bạn và tôi hy vọng được biết câu trả lời từ bạn
họ có hơn 75 loại dầu olive khác nhau , bao gồm cả những loại trong tủ khoá do chúng làm từ những cây olive hàng trăm tuổi
giờ là câu hỏi đầu tiên của ngày hôm nay , bạn có sẵn sàng để nghe về vấn đề quá tải trong lựa chọn ?
trong số những người dừng lại khi chúng tôi đưa ra 24 loại , chỉ có 3 % trong số họ mua 1 chai mứt .
và anh ta chỉ và đám đông khách du lịch thường xuyên vào mỗi ngày , được máy camera quay lại thường <unk> ,
chúng ta chọn không chọn gì cả thậm chí khi điều đó đi ngược lại với những điều chỉ tốt cho chúng ta .
chúng tôi đã quyết định thực hiện 1 thí nghiệm nhỏ , và chúng tôi đã lấy mứt cho cuộc thí nghiệm .
và chỉ có khoang 12 % sự quyết định được họ thực hiện thực hiện trong 1 tiếng hoặc hơn thế .
nếu không thì , khi tôi hỏi , và nếu bạn trả lời có , xin bạn vui vòng vỗ tay ,
và chúng tôi phát hiện rằng càng nhiều nguồn được đưa ra thì thật sự , tỉ lệ tham gia càng ít
đã có cuộc khảo sát được hoàn thành với các ceo mà chúng tôi đã theo các ceo suốt 1 tuần
bạn có biết bao nhiêu sự lựa chọn làm bạn mất trong khoảng 9 phút so với 1 tiếng ?
điều tiếp theo , chúng tôi nhận ra trong trường hợp nào mọi người thích mua 1 chai mứt .
và họ phát hiện ra là trung bình ceo đã làm khoảng <unk> nhiệm vụ trong 1 tuần
chúng tôi đã mở 1 quầy nếm thử nhỏ ngay gần cửa vào cửa hàng .
và điều chúng tôi phát hiện ra là trong đó tồn tại một sự tương quan
bạn có biết bạn thực hiện bao nhiêu sự lựa chọn trong 1 tuần ?
bạn nghĩ mình giỏi đến đâu trong việc quản lý các lựa chọn đó ?
tôi muốn nói về những vấn đề và những cách giải quyết khả thi .
dĩ nhiên , mỗi nhiệm vụ được bao gồm rất nhiều lựa chọn nhỏ
50 % trong số quyết định của ceo mất 9 phút hoặc ít hơn
bây giờ , nó gần như trở thành công viên giải trí .
chủ đề hôm nay sẽ tiếp tục với : tiết kiệm tài chính
bây giờ , nghĩ về những sự lựa chọn của chính bạn
bây giờ chúng ta thấy hiệu ứng ngược lại .
đây là cửa hàng với tên <unk> &apos; s
đây là gian hàng dầu olive của họ .
họ có hơn <unk> loại mứt khác nhau .
đây là gian hàng bán mứt của họ
cảm ơn .
khi proctor &amp; amp ; gamble giảm từ 26 loại head &amp; amp ; shoulders xuống 15 họ nhận thấy sự gia tăng doanh số bán hàng lên 10 %
và gary nói rằng anh ta sẵn sàng giúp đỡ mọi người trong buổi này 1 kì nghĩ tốn tiền miễn phí tới con đường đẹp nhất thế giới .
bây giờ tôi sẽ cho bạn vài giây để đọc nó sau đó tôi muốn bạn vỗ tay nếu bạn sẵn sàng nhận sự lời đề nghị của gary
đối với những ai đã lựa chọn tham gia càng nhiều sự lựa chọn hơn nữa thì càng nhiều người tham gia để tránh sự tồn kho .
hơn 1 thập kỉ trong quá khứ chúng ta đã chứng kiến 3 hậu quả tiêu cực chính khi đưa ra cho mọi người nhiều sự lựa chọn
trong những kế hoạch tài trợ gần 60 nguồn tài chính tỉ lệ tham gia hiện tại đã giảm khoảng 1 trong những 60 nguồn đó .
và điều đầu tiên tôi làm là yêu cầu những người đó &quot; nói cho tôi biết những sự lựa chọn khác nhau như thế nào .
họ thích trì hoãn sự lựa chọn sự trì hoãn thậm trí khi nó đi ngược lại lợi ích tốt nhất cho bản thân họ .
càng nhiều sự lựa chọn càng nhiều người gửi tất cả tiền của họ vào những tài khoản thị trường tài chính
bản đã nghe điều đó trước đây nhưng điều đó không đúng so với hiện nay mà ít hơn thì nhiều hơn
đối với những ai thực sự muốn chọn họ đưa ra 20 nguồn tài chính không phải 300 hay hơn đó .
họ dường như đưa ra những sự lựa chọn tệ hơn tệ hơn trong tài chính , y tế .
họ dường như chọn những điều làm họ ít hài lòng hơn khi họ có khả năng làm tốt hơn
bạn biết đó , trung bình các cửa hàng tạp hoá ngày nay đưa ra cho bạn <unk> sản phẩm
và nếu người làm công của bạn không thể phân biệt. thì người tiêu dùng của bạn cũng vậy .
<unk> khi chúng tôi bắt đầu phần chúng tôi buổi chiều nay tôi đã có cuộc nói chuyện với gary
mỗi người làm công ở <unk> được đăng kí tự động trong 1 nguồn .
mọi người luôn luôn lúng túng khi tôi nói , &quot; cắt giảm &quot;
người ta thường nói &quot; tôi không biết làm sao để cắt giảm &quot;
họ luôn lo lắng họ sẽ sắp sửa mất vị trí của họ
tốt . những ai sẵn sàng nhận sự đề nghị của gary .
bạn biết đây là sự lừa đảo , phải không nào .
bây giờ , ai sẵn sàng cho chuyến đi này nào ?
tôi nghĩ là tôi sẽ nghe được nhiều tiếng vỗ tay hơn
walmart thời nay đưa cho bạn tới 100.000 sản phẩm
tất cả đều là sự lựa chọn quan trọng
bây giờ tôi sẽ cho bạn thấy nhiều hơn
và tôi nghĩ bạn nên đọc nó .
đây là miêu tả của con người
đầu tiên : cắt giảm
đọc xong chứ ?
được rồi
và điều đó chỉ ra rằng làm nó càng rõ ràng , cụ thể thì càng trở thành 1 công cụ hiệu quả để giúp mọi người tiết kiệm hơn
tại sao mọi người sử dụng trung bình 15 đến 30 % khi họ sử dụng thẻ atm hay thẻ tín dụng so với tiền mặt ?
điều đó <unk> cho tôi kĩ thuật thứ hai trong việc giải quyết vấn đề quá tải lựa chọn mà rất cụ thể
sự phân chia cần phải nói lên điều gì đó tới người chọn chứ không phải là người thực hiện sự lựa chọn
và bạn thường thấy rằng vấn đề đó khi nó giảm xuống trong danh sách dài của tất cả nguồn tài chính
đây là hãng xe của đức mà cho bạn có cơ hội để tuỳ chỉnh xe theo ý bạn bạn muốn
và những lựa chọn đó làm thay đổi 1 lượng sự lựa chọn mà họ đưa ra mỗi quyết định .
và trong suốt giai đoạn này chúng tôi giữ lại giai đoạn trước đây nhưng chỉ thêm 1 điều nhỏ
chúng ta có thể giải quyết nhiều sự phân loại hơn là chúng ta giải quyết những sự lựa chọn
nếu bạn nghĩ hình bên trái là swing và hình bên phải là jazz thì xin mời bạn vỗ tay
còn nếu bạn nghĩ bên trái là jazz và bên phải là swing thì xin mời bạn vỗ tay .
bạn có hơn 60 quyết định khác nhau , để hoàn thành trang trí cho xe của bạn .
một thứ được gọi là &quot; jazz &quot; còn cái kia được gọi là &quot; swing &quot;
ví dụ , đây là 1 buổi chúng tôi đã làm ở gian hàng tạp chí
bên trái là jazz và bên phải là swing , nhưng bạn biết điều gì không
hãy suy nghĩ đến 1 sự lựa chọn khó khăn : mua 1 chiếc xe .
tôi chuẩn bị cho bạn 1 ví dụ về điều tôi đang nói đến
bởi vì sự phân chia cho tôi biết làm sao phân chia chúng
kĩ thuật thứ 4 của tôi : điều kiện cho sự phức tạp
màu xe , màu bên ngoài tôi có <unk> 56 <unk> lựa chọn
bởi vì bức tranh làm nó thực tế hơn với bạn
bây giờ , nó chỉ ra rằng bạn đã đúng .
chúng ta phải dần dần tăng độ phức tạp .
bây giờ là 2 loại nữ trang khác nhau
đây là sự sắp xếp rất vô ích .
ai là người trông mong được thông tin ?
động cơ , sang <unk> có 4 lựa chọn
bởi vì nó không giống như tiền thật
kĩ thuật thứ 3 : sự phân loại
tốt rồi , nhiều hơn 1 chút .
nhưng bạn biết điều gì không ?
tốt , có vài người .
cho nên 1 nửa khách hàng đi từ nhiều sự lựa chọn , 56 màu xe , tới 4 sự lựa chọn , 4 động cơ sang số .
và có lẽ tôi đã hành nghề đủ lâu để bỏ đi một chút cái uy tín mà tôi không đáng hưởng để có thể làm việc đó .
và chúng ta càng có thê kĩ lưỡng hơn trong lựa chọn chúng ta càng có thể tốt hơn trong việc thực hành nghệ thuật lựa chọn
giả dụ bạn bị viêm ruột thừa và bạn được đưa tới một bác sĩ giải phẫu với chỉ số phẫu thuật ruột thừa là 400 .
bạn có biết một cầu thủ với chỉ số đập bóng 300 trong giải vô địch bóng chày lớn được gọi là gì không ?
bởi vì tôi tin rằng chìa khoá để chọn cái tốt nhất từ sự lựa chọn đó là sự kĩ càng trong lựa chọn
trước khi tôi thật sự bắt đầu phần quan trọng của buổi thuyết trình , hãy bắt đầu bằng chuyện bóng chày nhé .
điều duy nhất tôi hoàn thành là tôi đã thay đổi đơn đặt hàng mà thông tin đó được biểu hiện trong đó
cho nên điều tôi sẽ làm là tôi sẽ thay đổi sự đặt hàng mà những quyết định đó tồn tại
tôi nghĩ ta phải làm gì đó về một &quot; truyền thống &quot; trong y học cần phải thay đổi .
tôi sẽ tập trung vào một con số mà tôi hi vọng nhiều bạn đã nghe nói tới .
thế nghĩa là cứ 10 lần đập bóng thì cầu thủ đó đập bóng an toàn 3 lần .
tiện thể , đó là một cầu thủ đập bóng cứ 10 lần được 4 lần an toàn .
họ đi từ sự lựa chọn thấp lên cao hơn thì họ đang mắc kẹt ở đó .
thế bạn có biết người ta gọi một cầu thủ với chỉ số 400 là gì không ?
nếu tôi bắt đầu với bạn dễ dàng , tôi học làm thế nào lựa chọn .
chúng ta sắp tới đích rồi , chúng ta sắp lọt vào cúp thế giới rồi .
và tôi nghĩ việc này bắt đầu từ một bác sĩ , đó là tôi .
môn bóng chày đầy rẫy những con số thống kê đáng kinh ngạc .
ví dụ là số 300 nhé , một cầu thủ đập bóng 300 .
với cùng nguồn thông tin , cùng số lượng sự lựa chọn .
ai mà chẳng yêu bóng chày , có phải không ?
tốt , cực tốt , có thể là siêu sao .
cứ 10 lần thì có 3 lần như vậy .
và có hàng trăm con số như thế .
điều tôi muốn nói là gì ?
đó là chỉ số đập bóng .
bạn thật bận rộn đó .
để tôi khái quát lại .
cảm ơn các bạn rất nhiều
ồ , tại sao không ?
chúng tôi đang thua họ
tôi học trong cái gác xép nhỏ bé của tôi ở khu tập thể y tá ở bệnh viện đa khoa toronto , không xa chỗ này lắm .
và nhiệm vụ của tôi khi nhân viên phòng cấp cứu yêu cầu khám tim , là tới khám bệnh nhân phòng cấp cứu
việc ta làm là đẩy họ , kể cả tôi vào thế giới với lời răn dạy , phải hoàn hảo .
ở trường phổ thông , bạn cùng lớp tôi nói rằng đi kiểm tra máu thì brian goldman cũng học .
và trong vòng chừng một tiếng rưỡi , hai tiếng sau đó , bà bắt đầu thấy dễ chịu hơn .
cô bác sĩ tim kia năm nay lên tay nghề nhiều . cô đang có một chuỗi thành công .
tôi biết cả những phương án chẩn bệnh khác nhau khi phân loại bệnh tăng axit do ống thận .
và giả thuyết ấy có vẻ đúng được một lúc cho tới khi tôi gặp bà <unk> .
và đó là lúc tôi phạm sai lầm đầu tiên ; tôi cho bà xuất viện .
tôi cho bà uống aspirin . tôi kê thuốc để giảm hoạt động của tim .
và trong suốt quá trình , tôi thu thập ngày càng nhiều kiến thức .
lúc đó tôi được giao nhiệm vụ ở khoa tim trực ban khoa tim .
tôi cho bà xuất viện mà không nói trước cho bác sĩ giám sát .
và đó là thông điệp tôi thấm nhuần khi tôi học trường y .
và khi tôi nghe bà thở , bà phát ra tiếng <unk> <unk> .
tôi là một học sinh bị ám ảnh bởi sự hoàn hảo .
tôi thi tốt , tôi tốt nghiệp xuất sắc , loại ưu .
tôi kê thuốc lợi tiểu để bà đi tiểu bớt dịch thừa .
và báo cáo lại với bác sĩ giám sát tôi .
và tôi gặp bà <unk> , bà rất khó thở .
tôi chẩn bệnh và bắt đầu điều trị cho bà .
rõ là việc này không ổn , đúng không ?
thực ra , tôi phạm 2 sai lầm nữa .
nhưng , nhưng , bạn có biết không ?
nhưng tôi sẽ hỏi các bạn một câu .
chẩn đoán bệnh này không phải là khó .
rõ là thế này vẫn chưa ổn .
và thế là tôi cố hoàn hảo .
và đạt chỉ số những <unk> .
và tôi thuộc <unk> mọi thứ .
và tôi cũng thấy tốt .
1000 , tuyệt vời .
và chị y tá nghĩ một lúc và nói đơn giản là , &quot; ồ , tôi nghĩ là bà ấy sẽ ổn thôi . &quot;
và sau khoảng chín ngày , họ để bà ra đi -- bà <unk> , người vợ , người mẹ , và người bà .
thế là tôi kí giấy tờ xuất viện , và xe cứu thương tới , y sĩ đưa bà về nhà .
và trong hai hay ba ngày sau đó , mọi sự rõ ràng là bà không bao giờ tỉnh dậy nữa .
cái loại hổ thẹn không lành mạnh tôi nói về là loại khiến cho bạn nôn nao trong lòng .
phần còn lại ngày hôm đó , chiều đó , tôi có cảm giác nôn nao trong lòng .
và anh biết bệnh nhân , anh sẽ có thể thêm thông tin về bà .
&quot; ồ , bà ấy quay lại rồi , &quot; đúng với giọng như thế .
và trong vòng tám hay chín ngày tiếp theo , họ đầu hàng số phận .
và bạn bù đắp thiệt hại và không bao giờ phạm lỗi thế nữa .
có lẽ tôi không muốn làm một thực tập viên phiền nhiễu .
&quot; anh có nhớ bệnh nhân anh cho xuất viện không ? &quot;
họ nói không bao giờ anh quên được tên người ra đi .
và bà gần như không thở nổi và bà xanh lét .
tôi nhớ rõ mọi sự như ngày hôm qua vậy .
tôi đi qua phòng cấp cứu trên đường về nhà .
và tôi bị sốc và run rẩy tới tận xương .
não bà bị huỷ hoại không thể thay đổi được .
và đó là lần đầu tôi biết đến việc đó .
lỗi lầm thứ hai của tôi còn tệ hơn .
và tôi quay lại làm việc ở phòng khám .
và nhân viên phòng cấp cứu dùng mọi cách .
có lẽ tôi có lí do đúng đắn .
3 chữ ấy là : có nhớ không ?
y tá kia hỏi đơn giản như thế .
ồ được rồi , bà phải quay lại .
bà quay lại và cận kề cái chết .
họ cho bà thuốc làm tăng huyết áp .
loại hổ thẹn này là một người thày .
nhưng tôi vẫn tiếp tục làm việc .
họ đặt bà vào máy thông thở .
và cả gia đình tụ họp lại .
anh nói chuyện với gia đình bệnh nhân , và tôi khá chắc chắn là anh dàn xếp ổn mọi chuyện và đảm bảo là tôi không bị kiện .
và đồng nghiệp tôi đang khám lại và khi anh phát hiện ổ bụng phía dưới bên phải bị đau , cũng gọi bác sĩ phẫu thuật .
trong cả hai trường hợp , tôi không cho bệnh nhân xuất viện và tôi không nghĩ là chăm sóc có gì thiếu sót cả .
và ngay cả khi anh ta đang đi bộ ra khỏi cửa , anh ta cũng kiều như đang chỉ về cổ .
tôi yêu cầu tiếp nước để bệnh nhân đỡ mất nước và nhờ đồng nghiệp khám lại cho anh ta .
loại đó nói rằng , không phải việc anh làm là xấu , mà chính anh là kẻ xấu .
tại sao tôi lại không hỏi bác sĩ hướng dẫn ? tại sao lại cho bệnh nhân về nhà ?
và trong những thời khắc khủng khiếp nhất : tại sao lại phạm sai lầm ngu ngốc đến thế ?
và không phải vì bác sĩ hướng dẫn của tôi ; anh ấy dễ mến vô cùng .
anh ta bị một căn bệnh có thể nguy hiểm tính mạng là viêm nắp thanh quản .
hai lần trong một ca trực cấp cứu , tôi không chẩn đúng bệnh viêm ruột thừa .
trong cả hai trường hợp , bệnh nhân đều được phẫu thuật và ổn cả .
nhưng mỗi lần , họ đều giày vò tôi , ngấu nghiến nhìn tôi .
&quot; anh có nhớ bệnh nhân đau họng anh khám không ? &quot;
anh phải tiêm thuốc kháng sinh và hồi phục sau vài ngày .
tôi xem cổ họng anh ta , nó hơi hồng hồng .
hoá ra là , anh ta không bị viêm họng thường .
lúc ấy rất bận rộn , tôi đang hơi vội .
và tôi kê đơn <unk> và cho anh ta đi .
và bà nói ba chữ này : có nhớ không ?
có một bệnh nhân tôi nghĩ là bị sỏi thận .
và may mắn là anh bệnh nhân không chết .
chậm nhưng chắc , cảm giác nhẹ dần .
tôi bắt đầu thấy khá hơn một chút .
bệnh nhân kia bị tiêu chảy rất nhiều .
và đó là điều tôi cảm thấy .
tại sao tôi học ngành y ?
và tôi quay lại làm việc .
và điều đó lại xảy ra .
anh ta cứ chỉ vào đó .
và tôi cứ tự hỏi .
và tiếng đó dừng thật .
trong một hệ thống bệnh viện nơi mà kiến thức y khoa tăng gấp đôi mỗi hai hay ba năm , ta không thể theo kịp .
nếu tôi đi vào một căn phòng -- như lúc này , tôi hoàn toàn không biết các bạn sẽ nghĩ gì về tôi .
trong đất nước này , tới <unk> người dân canada qua đời vì những sai sót y học có thể phòng tránh được .
và bệnh nhân của tôi không phải ô-tô ; không phải mỗi lần họ đều thuật lại triệu chứng theo cách giống nhau .
tôi vô cùng tiếc về điều đó , nhưng tôi cố gắng học một điều mà tôi có thể truyền cho người khác .
và nó gần như là một phản ứng trong tâm tưởng , như khi kháng thể bắt đầu tấn công người đó .
lúc là lần cuối bạn nghe ai đó nói về sai lầm , rồi sai lầm , rồi sai lầm ?
làm sao tôi dạy cho họ là tôi đã làm gì để họ không đi vào vết xe đổ ?
và bạn có biết việc người ta không muốn nói về những trường hợp tệ nhất của họ không ?
họ muốn được nói rằng , &quot; xem này , đừng đi vào vết xe đổ của tôi . &quot;
tôi không phải rô-bốt ; không phải lần nào tôi cũng theo y một qui trình .
họ muốn kể câu chuyện của họ . họ muốn sẻ chia câu chuyện của họ .
điều họ cần là một môi trường tạo điều kiện cho họ nói điều đó .
vài lỗi lầm của tôi diễn ra trong năm năm trở lại đây .
điều họ cần là một văn hoá y học cần xác định lại .
chị rất ủng hộ khi người khác nói về sai lầm của họ .
và điều tôi học được là sai sót có mặt khắp nơi .
ở hoa kì , viện y học đặt ra con số 100000 .
với những điều đó , sai lầm là bất khả kháng .
cô độc , tủi hổ , không được trợ giúp .
tôi không áp dụng cùng một tiền sử bệnh nữa .
và việc này bắt đầu từ từng y sĩ một .
chị chia sẻ trải nghiệm ấy với những người khác .
ta không thể tống khứ vấn đề này được .
tôi là một y sĩ theo khái niệm mới .
tôi là con người . tôi phạm sai lầm .
một sự chối bỏ hoàn toàn sai lầm .
nhưng có hai vấn đề với điều đó .
sự thiếu ngủ vô cùng phổ biến .
đó là hệ thống ta có .
và vấn đề là đây .
tên tôi là brian goldman .
năm ngoái , bear <unk> đã đăng tải video này ông ấy đã ghi hình bên ngoài căn nhà của mình ở công viên quốc gia yosemite .
jimmy kimmel đã đăng thế này trên twitter để rồi cuối cùng đã khiến video này trở nên phổ biến như bây giờ .
đây là biểu đồ thể hiện điều đó khi video này lần đầu tiên trở nên phổ biến vào mùa hè trước .
bất cứ ai trong các bạn đều có thể trở nên nổi tiếng trên mạng internet vào thứ 7 tuần tới .
có 3 lý do : những người tạo ra trào lưu , các cộng đồng tham gia và sự bất ngờ .
và tương tự như &quot; double rainbow &quot; có vẻ như nó chỉ nổi lên từ chỗ không có gì cả .
bởi vì đó là những gì bạn làm khi bạn là yosemite mountain bear ( con gấu ở núi yosemite .
và nếu như bạn đang tự hỏi về những đỉnh điểm khác , chúng cũng vào những ngày thứ 6 .
tôi vẫn không biết các bạn nghĩ gì về tôi , nhưng tôi có thể chịu được điều đó .
à , <unk> đã xem , và nhiều trang nhật ký trực tuyến bắt đầu viết về nó .
và xin để tôi kết thúc với ba chữ của chính tôi : tôi có nhớ .
&quot; friday &quot; của rebecca black là một trong những video phổ biến nhất năm nay .
nhưng có hơn 48 giờ video được tải lên youtube mỗi phút .
thực ra ông ấy đã đăng rất nhiều video về thiên nhiên .
thế còn ngày này là gì ? riêng ngày thứ 6 này ?
trong năm 2010 , video đã có 23 triệu lượt xem .
nhưng bear không cố ý tạo ra một video như vậy .
trong khi video này được đăng lên vào tận tháng 1 .
à , nó là một ngày thứ 6 , đúng thế .
ông ấy chỉ muốn mọi người nhìn thấy cầu vồng .
vậy điều này xảy đến như thế nào ?
đây là biểu đồ mô tả điều đó .
vậy điều gì xảy ra vào ngày này ?
ôi chúa ơi . ôi chúa ơi .
vậy điều gì xảy ra ở đây ?
thực ra nguyên do là jimmy kimmel .
với gần 200 triệu lượt xem .
chúng ta bắt đầu nào .
ôi chúa ơi !
<unk> , <unk> !
thật đấy .
wooo !
và nếu bạn nghĩ điều này thật kỳ quặc , bạn nên biết rằng có một phiên bản 3 giờ của nó nhận được 4 triệu lượt xem .
hoàn toàn gây ngạc nhiên và hài hước , casey <unk> đã đưa ý tưởng vui và ý kiến của mình cho 5 triệu lượt xem .
và thế là cách tiếp cận này vẫn tốt với bất cứ điều gì mới mẻ mà chúng ta làm một cách sáng tạo .
nhưng điều quan trọng ở đây là tính sáng tạo mà nó truyền cảm hứng trong nền văn hoá internet lạ lùng này .
và công ty nhỏ mới thành lập của tôi đang cố gắng thâm nhập vào môi trường bằng cách chú ý tới ...
và tất cả chúng ta đều cảm thấy vài sự sở hữu trong nền văn hoá nhạc pop của chính mình .
thậm chí trong 7 ngày đầu tiên , trong mỗi ngày đã có một video nhại theo được đăng tải .
kết quả là bây giờ có hơn 10000 phiên bản bắt chước &quot; friday &quot; trên youtube .
&quot; <unk> cat &quot; là một hình ảnh hoạt hình được lặp lại với nhạc lặp lại .
bởi vì bây giờ chúng ta không chỉ thưởng thức nó , mà chúng ta tham gia .
ai có thể dự đoán &quot; double rainbow &quot; hay rebecca black hay &quot; <unk> cat &quot;
hôm nay tôi sẽ trình bày về những phát hiện không ai ngờ tới .
đây là một đoạn video ngắn cho thấy những gì chúng tôi đang làm .
bạn có thể viết kịch bản gì chứa đựng điều này trong đó ?
và vì vậy nó đưa đến cho chúng ta môt câu hỏi lớn .
hiện tại tôi làm việc trong ngành công nghiệp năng lượng mặt trời .
video này đã có gần 50 triệu lượt xem vào năm nay .
những con mèo đang xem những con mèo khác xem video này .
và ai có thể dự đoán bất cứ gì về điều này ?
thậm chí những con mèo cũng đang xem video này .
video của bear <unk> : điều này có nghĩa gì ?
ai đó đã tạo ra một phiên bản cũ .
không ai phải cho phép ý tưởng của bạn .
... chú ý tới đóng góp từ cộng đồng .
có lẽ cần giây lát để chạy đoạn video .
có cả những bản phối khí lại .
và sau đó nó mang tầm quốc tế
hở . xin chờ một chút .
nó chỉ như thế này .
điều này có nghĩa gì ?
cảm ơn các bạn .
<unk> .
nó trở thành cánh cổng mạ vàng mở ra một thế giới đầy những cướp biển và đắm tàu và các hình ảnh trong trí tưởng tượng của tôi .
và thế là khi tôi thấy chiếc ipad , tôi thấy nó là một đạo cụ kể chuyện có khả năng kết nối độc giả trên khắp thế giới .
thời đó , khi người ấn chúng tôi muốn đi lại chúng tôi sẽ nhảy vào một cỗ xe ngựa và phóng vèo qua bầu trời .
chúng tôi trò chuyện là thời cuộc chẳng có gì thay đổi từ thời có bản sử thi ấn độ cổ đại mahabharata .
và thế là -- nó nói , &quot; quyển sách này là của ... &quot; và thế là tôi gõ tên tôi vào .
lúc đó tôi đang ở trong sa mạc , dưới bầu trời sao cùng ca sĩ theo đạo sufi , <unk> ali .
và có vẻ như công nghệ mới đáng lẽ phải tạo ra phép màu , chứ không phải tiêu diệt nó .
thế là thật ra tôi sắp vào và khởi động <unk> , một phần mềm ứng dụng tương tác cho ipad .
khi tôi còn là một cô bé nhỏ , ông tôi tặng tôi chiếc đồng hồ bỏ túi bằng bạc .
và cái mảnh công nghệ 50 năm tuổi này trở thành vật thể màu nhiệm nhất đối với tôi .
nó kết hợp hình ảnh , chữ , minh hoạ động , âm thanh , và cảm giác chạm .
chúng ta sẽ chỉ -- chúng ta có thể bỏ qua -- tôi sẽ bỏ qua video vậy ...
kết luận chúng tôi rút ra là phép màu đã &apos; được &apos; thay thế bằng máy móc .
câu chuyện của tôi bắt đầu ngay tại đây , ở rajasthan khoảng hai năm về trước .
ở đây nói là , &quot; hãy đặt tay bạn lên mỗi cái đèn , &quot;
ngày nay , chúng ta cũng làm điều tương tự với máy bay .
ngày nay , chúng ta cũng làm thế bằng khoan và máy móc .
và trên thực tế tôi biến thành một nhân vật trong quyển sách .
tự nhiên tôi thấy mình trở thành kẻ sợ công nghệ .
việc kể chuyện đang trở nên ngày càng đa giác quan .
tôi đã minh hoạ sách từ năm 16 tuổi .
nó biết ta đang cầm nó như thế nào .
được rồi . xin cám ơn rất nhiều .
và điều này khiến tôi buồn vô cùng .
chúng ngăn trở những cảm hứng sáng tạo .
nhưng ta đang làm gì với nó vậy ?
ồ , tôi hết giờ rồi sao ?
nó biết ta đang ở đâu .
công nghệ mặt trời là ...
đây không phải là ...
được rồi .
không .
đây là một chiếc bản đồ tự phóng to ra và nhấp nháy sáng và nó vạch phương hướng cho bạn trong suốt phần còn lại của quyển sách .
một ý tưởng khác hớp hồn tôi khi còn bé là nguyên một thiên hạ rộng lớn có thể bị thu vào một hòn bi duy nhất .
những nàng <unk> đáng thương này đã bị nhốt trong các căn phòng của <unk> suốt hàng ngàn năm trong một cuốn sách cũ kĩ mốc mọt .
nhưng nay với công nghệ di động , ta có thể mang các em nhỏ ra ngoài , vào thế giới tự nhiên bằng công nghệ .
một điều thật sự quan trọng nữa đối với tôi là việc tạo ra nội dung thật sự ấn độ nhưng vẫn hiện đại .
và điều xảy ra là bạn sẽ tạo ra một bộ sưu tập ảnh kĩ thuật số mà bạn có thể trưng lên mạng .
ý tưởng nhốt đom đóm trong lọ thuỷ tinh , không biết tại sao , luôn vô cùng thú vị đối với tôi .
một em bé london trưng ảnh một chú cáo và nói rằng , &quot; ồ , hôm nay tớ thấy con cáo . &quot;
lúc nào cũng thế , quyển sách thần tiên nào cũng có bản đồ , nhưng những bản đồ này đều tĩnh .
và điều đó tạo nên một loại mạng xã hội quanh bộ sưu tập ảnh kĩ thuật số mà bạn chụp được .
trong khả năng kết nối lại phép màu , trái đất và công nghệ , còn rất nhiều khả năng khác nữa .
vào vài thời điểm nhất định trong quyển sách , nó sẽ cho bạn thấy bí mật trong nó nữa .
và thế là bạn phải tạo ra tiếng gió và thổi lá đi và đọc phần còn lại của sách .
khi còn nhỏ , tôi có hàng loạt bộ sưu tập que , đá , sỏi và vỏ sò .
tôi sẽ bắt đầu bằng cách đưa ra một trang báo cáo nhàm chán về khoa học kỹ thuật .
đây chỉ là một trang báo cáo ngẫu nhiên mà tôi chọn ra từ trong tài liệu của tôi .
trong một chương khác , bạn phải chụp ảnh một mảnh vỏ cây và ghi chú tên nó .
và một câu chuyện còn phản ánh những vấn đề mới như là vấn nạn môi trường .
và thế là ở đây , bạn cần nghiêng ipad , để lấy đom đóm ra .
và thế là chũng ta mang họ trở về một cuốn sách thiếu nhi hiện đại .
đứa trẻ trong tôi vô cùng hứng thú bởi những khả năng như thế này .
một em bé ấn độ nói , &quot; hôm nay tớ thấy con khỉ . &quot;
và chúng sẽ chiếu sáng cho bạn qua phần còn lại của quyển sách .
và vì sao đó , ngày nay trẻ em không sưu tập nữa .
tiếp theo , nếu bạn có thể bật trang báo cáo này lên .
vào một thời điểm , màn hình của bạn đầy lá .
nào , tôi đã nói rất nhiều về phép màu .
thế , tôi sẽ đi vào bây giờ .
ở đây , đây là các nàng <unk> .
ta đang khai thác năng lượng mặt trời .
và một bản đồ mở ra .
xin cám ơn các bạn .
giờ câu hỏi tôi muốn đặt ra là , nếu bạn nhìn vào những đường cong theo quy luật số mũ này , chúng không nhân lên mãi mãi .
vì vậy , cái mà tôi muốn nói đến là điều có thể , là sự chuyển giao có thể chính là giai đoạn chúng ta đang trải qua .
và nếu mọi người nhìn vào cách các chất hoá học ấy được hình thành , chúng ta sẽ bắt đầu hiểu được chúng hình thành như thế nào .
tôi nghĩ rằng lí do của việc ấy là bởi tất cả chúng ta đều cảm thấy việc gì đó đang diễn ra tại thời điểm ấy .
cái mà tôi muốn chỉ cho mọi người thấy không phải là những chi tiết của trang báo cáo mà là cái mẫu chung của nó .
và không có tiền lệ trong lịch sử phát triển công nghệ về sự tự tăng tiến bằng cách thay đổi cường độ vài năm một .
và do đó , tôi nghĩ bức ảnh này có ý nghĩa của nó nếu mọi người nhìn vào nó với góc độ vài tỉ năm .
để làm được điều đó tôi sẽ nói về một đống thứ thực sự không có gì liên quan đến công nghệ và máy tính .
bởi vì quá trình chuyển giao này có vẻ rất khó đoán biết khi chúng ta đang ở ngay giữa của quá trình ấy .
hiện giờ , tôi đang lạc quan , vì vậy , tôi nghĩ rằng nó có thể đi theo cách này .
vì vậy , nói cách khác , tương lai dường như chùn lại một năm mỗi năm cho cả đời người .
nếu đúng như vậy , nó có nghĩa là chúng ta đang ở giữa giai đoạn của sự chuyển giao .
cán cân thời gian mà tôi muốn nhìn vào là cán cân thời gian của sự sống trên trái đất .
nếu bạn có thể chỉnh đèn cao hơn chút nữa , vì tôi cần dùng mẩu giấy ở đây .
nói cách khác , mỗi bậc ở đây tượng trưng cho một mức độ trong thang biểu diễn .
sự chuyển giao ấy đang diễn ra . chúng ta đều có thể cảm nhận được nó .
và chúng là những mẫu hình tế bào nguyên thuỷ nhất , những giọt dầu nhỏ đó .
tại sao chúng ta phải vẽ đường cong kỹ thuật theo những bán đường xong log ?
và đây là một điều mới chúng ta nhắc đến về bán đường cong log .
nhưng khi điều này xảy ra , mọi thứ thay đổi một cách định tính .
mọi thứ không thể mãi thay đổi nhanh chóng như chúng đang diễn ra .
và những giọt dầu như thế bắt đầu tách ra và phân chia .
trạng thái mới mà thế giới đang hướng tới là gì ?
và đó cơ bản là cái tôi muốn nói tới .
giờ , nếu bạn có thể chỉnh đèn cao hơn .
đó là tất cả những gì có thể xảy ra .
nó ở xa cách khi chúng ta tiến tới nó .
và chúng không cho chúng ta biết nhiều lắm .
có cái gì đó kỳ quặc ở đây .
chúng dường như chuyển động như thế này
một trong hai việc sẽ xảy ra .
nó không phải như vậy .
đó chỉ là một dạng hoá học cơ bản của sự sống , nhưng mọi thứ thú vị hơn khi những giọt ấy học được mẹo để chiết ra .
thực tế , mọi sinh vật sống đều được lưu trữ cấu tạo gen của nó bằng hệ thống kí tự và mật mã hoàn toàn tương tự .
nếu như tôi là một kẻ tự tôn tự phụ , tôi có thể đã biến nó thành một loại vi-rút và thả nó vào căn phòng này .
thực tế , một trong những điều tôi đã làm để tiêu khiển là chúng ta giờ có thể lưu trữ nhiều thứ bằng mật mã này .
và chúng bắt đầu hình thành nên những cấu hình đặc biệt có tác dụng không gì khác ngoài việc xử lí thông tin trong quần thể .
điều đáng ngạc nhiên là cách lưu trữ thông tin ấy có vẻ rất ổn định vì nó đã tiến hoá từ 2,5 tỉ năm trước .
nhưng sau đó điều xảy ra là các cá thể hình thành nên đương nhiên rồi , những mánh khoé trong việc trao đổi thông tin .
tôi có ở đây 100 <unk> bột trắng , thứ mà tôi thường phải cố gắng giấu nhân viên bảo vệ ở sân bay .
và tất cả mọi lần nó phân chia , chúng đều phân chia không đều những thành phần hoá học trong chúng .
thực tế , gen của chúng ta , có quy tắc giống hệt và có cách lưu trữ giống hệt như vậy .
bằng cách nào đó mà chúng ta không hiểu được , những giọt nhỏ ấy học cách để lại thông tin .
và nó tạo nên những tế bào này -- làm những tế bào này tồn tại thêm 1 tỉ năm nữa .
tôi không biết nếu các bạn biết điều này , nhưng vi khuẩn có thể thực sự trao đổi adn .
và vì vậy , quá trình tiếp theo rất thú vị trong sự sống mất khoảng 1 tỉ năm nữa .
tế bào thần kinh là bộ máy xử lí thông tin mà quần thể tế bào cấu tạo nên .
ví dụ như , phiên bản phức tạp nhất chúng ta biết đến là ngôn ngữ của loài người .
tôi có một suy nghĩ hết sức phức tạp , hỗn độn , và mơ hồ trong tâm trí .
vì vậy , những giọt có xu hướng tồn tại lâu hơn được thể hiện ra nhiều hơn .
nếu bạn nghĩ về nó , bạn sẽ thấy đó là một phát minh hết sức vĩ đại .
chúng ta có rất nhiều tế bào mà chúng không thể tồn tại một cách riêng rẽ .
những quần thể tế bào này , một lần nữa , bắt đầu chiết ra thông tin .
bởi vì vậy mà , ví dụ , sự kháng thuốc kháng sinh được hình thành .
bởi quá trình tiến hoá ngày nay có thể xảy ra bên trong một cá thể .
và trong thực tế , chúng ta chính là một quần thể đa tế bào .
và đó là bộ não và hệ thống thần kinh của những quần thể ấy .
và vì vậy , tất cả các giọt đều khác nhau đôi chút .
quá trình tiếp theo xảy ra là ở trong những quần thể này .
và chúng đem đến sự thuận lợi trong quá trình tiến hoá .
nó có thể xảy ra trong thời gian xử lí thông tin .
thiết lập một cấu trúc adn là một bước thú vị .
và đó là những cấu trúc thần kinh .
vậy bước tiếp theo là gì ?
và tôi nói , &quot; máy tính , liệu bạn có thể chọn ra 10 % trong số dãy ngẫu nhiên đó mà thực hiện công việc tốt nhất .
và chúng đều liên kết chúng ta thành một cộng đồng lớn hơn nhanh hơn và có khả năng tiến hoá xa hơn chúng ta trước đây .
điều mà chúng tôi làm là đặt vào trong máy một quy trình phát triển xảy ra trong khung thời gian giây cực nhỏ .
quá trình tiếp theo , như ngôn ngữ và những thứ tương tự , xảy ra trong vòng ít hơn một triệu năm .
và tôi nghĩ rằng đó là thứ mà chúng ta đang thấy ở đây , trong sự bùng nổ của đường cong này .
hay nói cách khác , &quot; máy tính , liệu bạn có thể đưa ra hàng trăm triệu dãy câu lệnh ngẫu nhiên .
và trên thực tế , điều chúng ta đã thực hiện là loài người chúng ta , bắt đầu biết chọn lọc .
và trên thực tế , đôi khi chúng thực hiện bởi những phương pháp chúng tôi thậm chí không hiểu rõ lắm .
và những giai đoạn tiếp theo , như hệ thống thần kinh và não bộ , mất vài trăm triệu năm .
vì vậy những bước đầu tiên của câu chuyện tôi kể cho mọi người xảy ra trong 1 tỉ năm .
ví dụ như , sự phát minh ra tiếng nói là một bước tiến nhỏ theo chiều hướng ấy .
và những quá trình tiếp theo , như điện , dường như chỉ mất có một vài thập kỷ .
một phương pháp đặc biệt thú vị mà tôi hiện vẫn đang dùng nhiều là bản thân sự tiến hoá
khi tôi muốn sắp xếp các số , một ví dụ đơn giản mà tôi thực hiện được .
nhưng một trong số đó , nếu may mắn , sẽ đặt hai số vào đúng vị trí .
và tiếp theo hãy sao chép lại những dãy câu lệnh sắp xếp các con số tốt nhất .
và hãy sao chép chúng bằng quá trình tái tổ hợp tương tự như sinh sản . &quot;
vậy giờ đây , tiến hoá có thể xảy ra trong thời khắc vài phần giây .
tôi không biết công dụng của tất cả các bóng bán dẫn trong máy kết nối .
việc này cho phép chúng ta bắt đầu tồn tại như một cơ thể sống .
quá trình thay đổi càng nhiều , tốc độ nó thay đổi càng nhanh .
và tìm chương trình gần gũi nhất với công việc sắp xếp con số .
và thử lại lần nữa , thực hiện nó cho một thế hệ khác .
tất cả mọi cá nhân trong thế hệ mới đều chỉ mất vài <unk> .
giờ chúng ta đã tăng tốc khung thời gian lên một lần nữa .
chúng ta đang thấy quá trình này tự thúc đẩy bản thân nó .
tôi nói với máy tính , &quot; hãy lặp lại quá trình . &quot;
nói cách khác , tôi xác định thứ tôi muốn .
giữ chúng lại . loại đi dãy còn lại .
có thể đưa ra vài sự hoán đổi .
bởi có hàng tỉ bóng bán dẫn .
đánh giá lại chúng một lần nữa .
chúng ta đang sử dụng những chương trình ấy để tạo ra máy tính nhanh hơn để từ đó chúng ta có thể thực hiện quá trình nhanh hơn .
và chúng ta đang ở thời điểm trong quá trình mà tương tự như khi những cơ thể sống đơn bào chuyển sang cơ thể sống đa bào .
và tôi nghĩ rằng tất cả chúng ta ở đây là một phần của sự sản sinh thế hệ tiếp theo - bất kể đó là cái gì .
vì vậy , chúng ta bắt đầu phụ thuộc vào máy tính để thực hiện một quá trình khác biệt hơn hẳn với thiết kế xây dựng .
nhưng điều mà họ thực sự đang làm nhằm chứng tỏ mọi thứ đều có thể xảy ra trong xã hội công nghệ thông tin ngày nay .
và nó cho phép chúng ta sản xuất ra những sản phẩm phức tạp hơn nhiều so với thiết kế xây dựng bình thường cho phép .
tôi nghĩ rằng chúng ta sẽ quá là tự cao nếu cho rằng chúng ta là sản phẩm cuối cùng của quá trình tiến hoá .
bữa trưa đang tới gần , và tôi nghĩ tôi sẽ dừng lại tại đây , trước khi tôi bị loại ra bởi tạo hoá .
trên thực tế , chúng ta đều biết rằng quá trình thiết kế xây dựng không được thuận lợi khi nó quá phức tạp .
giờ nếu tôi nhìn vào những chương trình ấy , tôi không thể cho mọi người biết chúng hoạt động như thế nào .
chúng ta là những trùng amip và chúng ta gần như không thể hiểu nổi thứ mà chúng ta đang chế tạo ra .
chương trình này được gọi là code for america và chương trình này khá giống peace corps cho dân nghiền máy tính .
điều này đang diễn ra ngày càng nhanh và đó là lí do tại sao tôi thấy nó khá mơ hồ .
thay vì đưa họ tới thế giới thứ ba , chúng tôi đưa họ tới sự náo nhiệt của thành phố .
làm thế nào nó có thể tìm kiếm sự giúp đỡ trong tình trạng có một không hai như thế này ?
kết thúc quá trình , tôi sẽ có chương trình chắc chắn hoàn hảo với việc sắp xếp con số .
chúng tôi lựa chọn một vài ứng viên mỗi năm , họ sẽ làm việc với chính quyền thành phố .
ở đó , họ sẽ viết ra nhứng ứng dụng tuyệt vời , làm việc với đội ngũ nhân viên .
trên thực tế , chúng là chương trình hiệu quả hơn nhiều chương trình tôi có thể viết tay .
trên thực tế , sự tồn tại của những chương trình ấy phụ thuộc vào cái công việc ấy .
tôi luôn cố gắng thăm dò chúng và chỉ cho bạn cách nó hoạt động .
và vì vậy , trong một góc nhìn , nó đang tiến trước chúng ta .
bởi tất cả công nghệ này đều tự thúc đẩy bản thân nó phát triển .
vậy mà chúng ta vẫn không thực sự hiểu sự lựa chọn của nó .
nhưng tôi nghĩ rằng có một cái gì đó đang bám đuổi chúng ta .
và vì vậy , nó đang thúc đẩy chính bản thân nó .
chúng là những chương trình rất mơ hồ và kì quặc .
chúng ta đang ở thời điểm của sự chuyển giao .
al là một vòi nước cứu hoả tại boston .
nhưng chúng thực hiện được công việc .
chúng ta đang cất cánh .
hãy nói đến al .
hiện nay có một dự án trong hệ thống luật pháp california đã tiêu tốn những người đóng thuế hai tỉ đô-la , mà vẫn không hoạt động .
nó cho thấy cách mà chính phủ có thể hoạt động hiệu quả hơn -- không giống các công ty tư nhân , như nhiều người nghĩ .
đó là một tin vui , bởi chúng ta sẽ có nhiều hơn những hành động cộng động với sự giúp sức của công nghệ điện tử .
ngày nay có một cộng đồng lớn những người giúp xây dựng các công cụ cần thiết để chúng ta cùng nhau làm việc hiệu quả .
nếu bạn biết bất cứ điều gì về công nghệ của nhà nước , bạn sẽ biết rằng việc này xảy ra không bình thường .
thế là anh ấy làm công việc mà bất cứ lập trình viên tài giỏi nào cũng sẽ làm là viết một ứng dụng .
sau đó seattle quyết định sử dụng phần mềm này để giúp người dân tránh khỏi nơi có đường ống dẫn nước bị tắc .
năm ngoái , chúng tôi có một đội gồm ba người làm việc trong một dự án kéo dài hai tháng rưỡi ở boston .
mỗi lần làm như vậy , bạn phải đặt tên cho nó , và anh ấy đặt tên chiếc đầu tiên là al .
việc những chiếc đèn này hoạt động rất quan trọng , nhưng có người lại ăn cắp năng lượng từ chúng .
chicago ứng dụng phần mềm cho phép mọi người đăng ký quét dọn vỉa hè khi trời có tuyết .
điều đó đồng nghĩa với sự không kiểm soát , luôn gợi mở và sản sinh những điều mới .
có lẽ là nhỏ nhất trong số 21 ứng dụng và các thành viên viết vào năm ngoái .
năm ngoái , chúng tôi có một đội ở boston tham gia chương trình code for america .
và còn nhiều dự án tương tự khác ở mọi cấp độ trong hệ thống chính quyền .
và thậm chí không giống 1 công ty công nghệ , mà giống internet thì đúng hơn .
họ để ý rằng thành phố không bao giờ tháo bỏ những vòi nước chữa cháy .
đó là một ứng dụng nhỏ mà bạn có thể định vị các vòi chữa cháy .
việc này đang lan rộng một cách chóng mặt , có trật tự , và tự nhiên
dự án giúp cha mẹ tìm kiếm trường công lập phù hợp với con cái mình .
hiện tại có chín thành phố đang lên kế hoạch sử dụng ứng dụng này .
vì thế anh ấy giúp người dân có thể kiểm tra những chiếc đèn .
nhưng nó đã làm một việc mà không một chính phủ nào làm .
nếu bạn không làm , người khác có thể chiếm đoạt nó .
việc cho ra đời một phần mềm thường mất vài năm .
bạn có thể khoá nó lại khi trời có tuyết
vậy là có chút động lực cho việc này .
họ ở đó trong tháng hai đầy tuyết .
nhưng những con số chẳng là gì cả .
đây là một ứng dụng nhỏ .
nó lan truyền rộng rãi .
điều đó thật quan trọng .
trong bản báo cáo tiếp theo có viết , &quot; tôi đang đi bộ trong khu vực , thì thấy 1 thùng rác phía sau nhà .
và nếu bạn là một trong số những người đó , tôi yêu cầu bạn cân nhắc lại , bởi mọi thứ đang thay đổi .
sau hai năm , tôi rút ra được kết luận đặc biệt với chính quyền địa phương , về những chú chuột <unk>
nó còn có 1 ứng dụng , 1 website và 1 ứng dụng trên điện thoại , mang tên citizens connect .
giống như nhiều người , tôi đã nghĩ chính phủ cơ bản chỉ là bắt mọi người đi bầu cử .
họ thấy nản lòng với chính phủ , nhưng họ không than phiền , họ tìm cách sửa chữa .
anh ấy không hề nghĩ đến điều gì khác . anh bắt đầu với việc kiểm soát động vật .
đây là thành quả của những con người xuất sắc tại văn phòng cơ học thành phố tại boston .
đây cũng là một ví dụ điển hình khác về việc chính phủ triển khai trò chơi cộng đồng .
nhưng trên citizens connect , mọi thứ đều được công khai , để tất cả có thể thấy .
điều này thật thú vị . đây chính là cách công nghệ tiếp cận với đời sống thực .
và những con người này biết rằng chúng ta đã không để chú trọng đến nó .
1 chú chuột <unk> sao ? thử kiểm tra xem . còn sống ? đúng vậy .
đây sẽ là nơi bạn đến nếu bạn gọi 311 từ thành phố của bạn .
khi bắt đầu chương trình này , tôi không biết mấy về chính phủ .
giờ đây có rất nhiều người mất niềm tin vào chính phủ .
anh ấy gõ &quot; <unk> &quot; vào kho dữ liệu chính thức .
và điều đó đã đúng . một tràng vỗ tay cho scott .
và trong trường hợp này , một người hàng xóm đã thấy .
nhưng đó không phải tất cả về loại chuột <unk> .
dựng thùng rác lên , rồi đi bộ về nhà .
chúc ngủ ngon , chú chuột <unk> đáng yêu . &quot;
chính trị không thay đổi ; chính phủ đang .
đây là trung tâm thông tin và liên lạc .
nhưng chuyện xảy ra với citizens connect lại khác .
làm thế nào để xử lý nó ? &quot;
boston không chỉ có một tổng đài .
chúng tôi không viết ứng dụng này .
scott nhận thức được điều này .
scott nói chuyện trực tiếp .
họ chưa từ bỏ
khá đơn giản .
giờ đây độ tuổi trung bình của các thành viên trong nhóm chúng tôi là 28 , thật ghen tị là tôi gần như già hơn tất cả họ .
đó có thể là việc xử lý vòi nước chữa cháy , dọn đống cỏ dại , dựng lại thùng rác có 1 chú chuột <unk> bên trong .
chúng ta sẽ đạt được những điều chúng ta cần phải làm mà không chấn chỉnh lại chính quyền đại diện cho tất cả chúng ta không ?
cuộc chiến của họ không giống chúng ta không phải việc ai sẽ là người lên tiếng ; mà tất cả họ sẽ phải làm điều đó .
khi họ đối mặt với vấn đề của chúng phủ , họ có thể không quan tâm lắm đến việc sử dụng tiếng nói của mình .
đó là vị chính phủ giống như một đại dương mênh mông và chính trị chỉ là một lớp dày 6 inch trên bề mặt .
họ có thể đưa ra ý kiến trên bất cứ phương tiện nào và vào lúc nào , và họ vẫn đang làm điều đó .
nếu chúng ta muốn chính quyền làm việc cho mình , chúng ta phải khiến cho hệ thống đó trở nên hấp dẫn .
chúng ta không thể làm vậy nếu không có chính phủ , chúng ta cần nó để đạt được hiệu quả hơn .
phần lớn mọi người hiểu điều đó , nhưng họ lại nghĩ rằng cái này là đầu vào cho cái kia .
họ sử dụng đôi bàn tay của mình để viết lên những ứng dụng giúp chính phủ làm việc tốt hơn .
một trong những điều quan trọng chúng ta cần nghĩ về chính phủ là nó không giống với chính trị .
nếu gọi trung tâm quản lý động vật , điều đó sẽ tiêu tốn nhiều tiền bạc hơn .
mọi người giúp đỡ lẫn nhau , nhưng chính phủ đóng vai trò cốt lõi ở đây .
khi người này giúp người kia , cộng đồng của chúng ta trở nên lớn mạnh hơn .
tôi chỉ đang nói về một hệ thống hỗ trợ con người giúp đỡ lẫn nhau .
và những gì ở phía dưới được chúng ta gọi là bộ máy quan liêu .
bạn phải nhận ra những thách thức to lớn mà chúng sẽ phải đối mặt .
đây là thế hệ dùng tiếng nói của mình để đấu tranh cho quyền lợi .
nhưng đó cũng là ví dụ về việc chính phủ như một hệ thống .
không hẳn là tôi nói về định nghĩa của hệ thống trong công nghệ .
bởi đó là nơi những công việc thực sự của chính phủ diễn ra .
đó không phải là chính trị , mà là hệ thống quan liêu .
rằng đầu vào cho hệ thống chính phủ và việc bầu cử .
chúng ta nói ra những từ ngữ đó với sự khinh miệt .
chúng ta phải đầu tư vào cơ cấu bộ máy chính phủ .
những ứng dụng này giúp chính ta cả thiện xã hội .
nó kết nối hai người đó lại với nhau .
có người cho rằng chính trị rất hấp dẫn .
bạn đã bao giờ thấy những con người này ?
đó chính là những gì <unk> đã làm .
họ sử dụng đôi bàn tay của mình .
nhưng điều làm cho thiết bị này đơn giản là bất cứ khi nào tôi đứng lên cân , nó đều gửi dữ liệu của tôi qua google health
và bạn không chỉ có thể thực hiện với những kỹ thuật kiểu như thế này , mà còn nhờ vào &quot; giải pháp đám đông &quot;
làm ra những kỹ thuật dễ sử dụng và bắt đầu với chúng để tạo cảm giác dễ chịu cho các bệnh nhân trong nhóm
và một trong số những điều mà chúng tôi đã làm tôi xin chia sẻ với các bạn một đoạn phim nho nhỏ .
và đây là những gì chúng tôi đã làm , chúng tôi đã sử dụng &quot; giải pháp đám đông &quot; ở hà lan
một trong những điều mà chúng tôi thực hiện tại trường đại học <unk> là bổ nhiệm một chuyên viên lắng nghe
chắc chắn , chúng ta có thể xử lý vòi nước chữa cháy , và nhiều người đã làm vậy .
và chúng ta không thể ổn định chính phủ cho đến khi chúng ta làm tốt nhiệm vụ công dân .
và tôi thực sự nghĩ rằng điều quan trọng nhất là chúng ta không còn lắng nghe bệnh nhân nữa .
không ai biết nơi có thiết bị <unk> gần nhất để cứu sống tính mạng bệnh nhân ngay lúc này .
tôi muốn nói với các bạn lý do tại sao nhiều dự án y tế điện tử lại thất bại
đây là chiếc cân điện tử của tôi . đó là một thiết bị rất đơn giản .
như một số các bạn biết rằng tôi có hơn 4,000 người theo dõi trên trang twitter .
đó là đồng hồ đo huyết áp có kết nối với iphone hay một thứ gì khác .
và chắc chắn rằng chúng ta có thể tìm thấy chuỗi cửa hàng thức ăn nhanh .
nhưng ở đâu có thiết bị <unk> gần nhất để có thể giúp bệnh nhân này ?
và hơn 10,000 thiết bị <unk> ở hà lan đã được tìm thấy và gửi về .
chúng ta biết chính xác máy atm ở những đâu trong thành phố <unk> này .
một thứ khác nữa là chúng ta biết tất cả các trạm xăng ở đâu .
và đúng là tôi rất lo và hồi hộp như bạn có thể thấy .
vào tuần tới , một thiết bị sẽ sớm được ra mắt .
bước tiếp theo chúng tôi tìm những trình ứng dụng cho nó .
nó có một nút bấm ở giữa để bật / tắt .
chúng tôi đã hỏi xung quanh và không ai biết cả .
chúng tôi có thể giúp gì được cho bạn ? &quot;
chúng ta đều có thiết bị định vị trong xe .
chúng ta thậm chí còn có nó trong điện thoại .
hơn thế , chúng ta là những công dân .
vào mỗi buổi sáng tôi đứng lên cân .
tôi sợ rằng mình tăng đến <unk> .
nhưng một điều khác nữa .
xin cảm ơn .
và ngày hôm nay chúng tôi xin giới thiệu thiết bị này không chỉ là <unk> mà sản phẩm này được gọi , mà còn là <unk> .
nhưng kết hợp theo một cách nào đấy , chúng tạo ra một thứ mà trông vẫn như thể ba chiều , như thể nó tồn tại .
vì vậy xin hãy giúp chúng tôi thực hiện điều này và không chỉ để sức khoẻ tốt hơn và còn kiểm soát được nó .
nên tôi muốn tạo ra một sự khác biệt , một thứ gì đó tại nơi quá trình bắt đầu khi bạn bấm nút .
chúng tôi làm một ứng dụng trên <unk> nhằm tăng cường khả năng thực tế để tìm được những thiết bị <unk> này .
sở thích về nhiếp ảnh của tôi đã bắt đầu khi tôi có một <unk> máy ảnh điện tử ở tuổi 15 .
những bức ảnh nơi mà bạn sẽ cần một chút thời gian để tư duy để tìm ra một bí quyết .
nó không thực sự là cái gì là thực , nó là cái chúng ta nghĩ rằng nó là thực .
và khi bạn dùng máy ảnh để chụp ảnh , quá trình kết thúc khi bạn bấm nút .
nên nhiếp ảnh với tôi như là thiên về việc có mặt đúng chỗ , đúng thời điểm .
những tấm ảnh như thế này : việc xây dựng diễn ra dọc theo con đường đông đúc .
vì , có lẽ , đây là nhiếp ảnh mà bạn không thể mang theo máy ảnh .
nên nó thực sự là việc nắm bắt ý tưởng hơn là nắm bắt một khoảnh khắc .
khi tôi nói tính chân thực , ý ́ tôi là tính chân thực của ảnh .
và tôi thấy rằng kết hợp các bức ảnh cũng có chung một quá trình như thế
tôi ở đây để chia sẻ với các bạn phong cách nhiếp ảnh của tôi .
có phải là một chút gì đó về chi tiết hay là về màu sắc ?
nhưng cùng một lúc với nhau , chúng ta biết là không thể được .
đó thực sự chỉ là <unk> việc kết hợp các hiện thực khác nhau .
và chúng tôi muốn bắt đầu thiết bị này trên toàn thế giới .
tôi cảm thấy như bất cứ ai cũng có thể làm điều đó .
và bất chấp điều đó , nó lưu giữ mức độ chân thực .
hãy để tôi cho các bạn xem một ví dụ đơn giản này .
nhưng bí quyết là gì mà khiến nó trông như có thật ?
nên tôi nghĩ những điều cơ bản thì khá là đơn giản .
và chúng tôi xây dựng một ứng dụng trên ipad
nhưng nó có một khúc ngoặt không mong muốn .
có phải một chút gì đó về ánh sáng ?
nó có phải là nhiếp ảnh không nhỉ ?
đôi khi phối cảnh tạo nên ảo giác .
điều gì tạo nên ảo giác ?
cám ơn các bạn .
và hai bức ảnh nay đều cùng thoả mãn hai điều kiện -- được chụp ở cùng một độ cao và ở cùng một kiểu ánh sáng .
bạn không cần phải là một kĩ sư để có thể xây nên những căn nhà đẹp , những cây cầu đẹp hay những toà nhà đẹp .
chúng giúp chúng ta xây dựng những thứ lớn hơn bản thân mình , các toà nhà , các cây cầu , từng viên gạch một .
theo ước tính , có hơn 400 tỉ viên gạch lego đã được sản xuất -- hay 75 viên cho mỗi người trên trái đất .
và nữa , tôi thậm chí còn đặt ngôi nhà lên đỉnh của hòn đảo làm cho nó trông thuỵ điển hoá hơn .
mọi công cụ đều ở ngay đây , và thứ duy nhất làm giới hạn của chúng ta chính là trí tượng tượng .
và nếu các bạn giỏi chụp ảnh , kết quả có thể sẽ rất tuyệt vời và cũng khá là thực tế .
nên tôi muốn đưa ra ba nguyên tắc cơ bản cần tuân theo để đạt được một kết quả như ý .
ai đó có thể nghĩ rằng đây chỉ là bức ảnh phong cảnh và phần ở dưới đã được chỉnh sửa .
nhưng bức ảnh này thì đã hoàn toàn được tạo ra bởi những bức ảnh từ các khu vực khác nhau .
những viên gạch đã nhanh chóng trở thành loại vật liệu xây dựng được sử dụng nhiều nhất trên thế giới .
nên để <unk> đạt được một kết quả chân thực , tôi nghĩ nó đi đến việc lập kế hoạch .
điều này nghe có vẻ kì lạ , nhưng tôi là một fan bự của những viên gạch bê tông .
có thể nói gạch bê tông đã trở thành những viên gạch xây nên kỉ nguyên của chúng ta .
như các bạn thấy ở đây , những bức ảnh này trông chẳng có gì là đặc biệt .
nên nguyên tắc đầu tiên đó là sự kết hợp các bức ảnh nên có chung một ngoại cảnh
và chỉ trong vài năm ngắn ngủi , những viên gạch lego đã có mặt tại mọi nhà .
nhưng kết hợp lại , chúng có thể tạo ra một thứ như thế này .
thứ hai , kết hợp các bức ảnh nên có cùng một kiểu ánh sáng .
sau gần 100 năm , vào năm 1947 , lego đã giới thiệu thứ này .
luôn có một sự bắt đầu với một phác thảo , một ý tưởng .
khó có thể nói làm thế nào hình ảnh được tạo ra
ví dụ , con cá được bắt trong chuyến đi câu .
nhưng nó thực sự đòi hỏi rất nhiều kế hoạch .
phần dưới nước thì được chụp trong một hố đá .
tiếp đó là kết hợp các bức ảnh khác nhau .
và đây , các phần được sắp xếp rất ổn .
lego đã làm điều đó trở nên khả thi .
bờ biển thì ở một nơi khác .
sau đây là một ví dụ .
nó được gọi là gạch tự gắn
cảm ơn .
cũng trong chính năm đó , ở phòng thí nghiệm bell một cách mạng kế tiếp sắp được công bố , thế hệ tiếp theo của những viên gạch .
đối với những người không phải kĩ sư , <unk> đã trở thành một dạng vật liệu khác , điện tử đã trở thành một vật liệu mới .
lego đã lấy khối gạch bê tông , những khối gạch xây nên thế giới , và làm nó thành những viên gạch của trí tưởng tượng .
thay vì phải lập trình , nối dây hay hàn mạch , <unk> cho phép bạn lập trình bằng những thao tác trực quan đơn giản .
giống như viên gạch bê tông , transistor cho phép bạn xây những mạch điện lớn và phức tạp hơn , từng viên gạch một .
xanh lá cây là đầu ra , xanh biển là nguồn điện , hồng là đầu vào và da cam là dây dẫn .
chúng tôi muốn tích hợp mọi tương tác trên thế giới vào những &quot; viên gạch &quot; có thể sử dụng dễ dàng .
thay núm xoay bằng khối tạo xung , như thế này , và giờ bạn đã có một mạch đèn nhấp nháy .
ánh sáng , âm thanh , tấm pin mặt trời , động cơ -- mọi thứ đều có thể tiếp cận được .
như các bạn đã thấy , không chỉ đơn giản để chơi <unk> còn tỏ ra là một công cụ mạnh .
và ở đây bạn sẽ thấy , cùng với vải nỉ , giấy và chai nước , <unk> đã làm ra ...
đây là ví dụ về dự án mà họ đã làm , súng bắn hoa giấy kích hoạt bằng cử động .
chúng đã được thiết kế sẵn để trở thành ánh sáng , âm thanh , động cơ và cảm biến .
ý tưởng đằng sau <unk> là xem nó như thể một dạng thư viện đang được phát triển .
bạn cho một núm xoay vào giữa và giờ bạn có thể chỉnh sáng tối cho đèn .
và phần thú vị nhất về chúng là chúng kết dính với nhau nhờ nam châm .
gắn thêm chiếc chuông điện này và giờ bạn đã tạo ra máy tạo tiếng động .
bạn gắn xanh biển với xanh lá , bạn có thể làm ra mạch đèn .
đó là một con tôm hùm làm bằng đất nặn và nó sợ bóng tối .
nhưng có một sự khác biệt lớn : transistor chỉ dành cho chuyên gia .
chúng tôi đã đưa <unk> cho trẻ nhỏ và xem chúng chơi với <unk> .
<unk> là những cấu kiện điện tử với những chức năng khác nhau .
và chúng tôi muốn vật liệu này tiếp cận được với mọi người .
những &quot; viên gạch &quot; này đã được đánh dấu bằng màu .
hãy đợi đã , đây là dự án ưa thích của tôi .
một vài năm trước tôi đã bắt đầu phát triển <unk> .
chúng tôi cũng đưa <unk> tới các trường dạy thiết kế .
để tôi cho bạn thấy chúng hoạt động ra sao .
nên bạn không thể đặt chúng sai được .
và đó là một trải nghiệm tuyệt vời .
thế nên <unk> là dự án mở .
tôi sẽ tắt tiếng này đi .
họ được thúc đẩy vì những mục đích khác -- chống đối chính phủ , bất đồng chính kiến , và đôi khi cũng chỉ để vui đùa .
một số ví dụ điển hình về những triệu phú đến từ thế giới mạng những người kiếm được bộn tiền từ hoạt động tấn công mạng .
các nhóm như anonymous đã nổi dậy trong 12 tháng qua và đã trở thành một lực lượng trọng yếu trong cuộc chơi tấn công mạng này .
đây là một ví dụ điển hình về những gì sẽ xảy ra khi chính phủ thực hiện tấn công chống lại người dân của chính họ .
vào thập kỷ 80 tại đông đức cũ nếu bạn sở hữu một chiếc máy đánh chữ bạn sẽ phải đăng ký nó với chính quyền
<unk> là một công ty cấp phép chứng thực đến từ hà lan -- hoặc ít nhất họ cũng đã từng là như vậy .
không những vậy , bạn còn phải đăng ký một bản tài liệu mẫu được xuất ra từ chiếc máy đánh chữ đó .
họ đã phải nộp đơn xin phá sản mùa thu năm ngoái vì hệ thống mạng của họ đã bị phá huỷ .
họ sử dụng các hoạt động tấn công trực tuyến để kiếm thật nhiều tiền , rất rất nhiều tiền .
trong tương lai không xa , phần lớn các vụ phạm pháp sẽ xảy ra ở trên thế giới mạng .
mục đích của việc này là để chính quyền có thể biết được nguồn gốc của những tài liệu đó
và đây cũng chính là một trong ba nguồn gốc chính cho những vấn đề trên mạng hiện nay .
và một sự thật rõ ràng là những hiểm hoạ này đang ngày càng trở nên tồi tệ hơn .
loại tấn công mạng thứ hai mà chúng ta thấy hiện nay không đến vì mục đích kiếm tiền .
bạn có thể lên trang web , tải về những file thiết kế và tự làm chúng .
chúng ta sẽ không bao giờ làm như vậy tại chính những quốc gia của mình .
và có vẻ như không ai định &quot; làm ầm lên &quot; về chuyện này .
như ở đây , chúng ta có <unk> <unk> đến từ thành phố kiev , ukraine
và động lực của loại tội phạm mạng này rất đơn giản và dễ hiểu .
jain hiện đang lẩn trốn ; và không ai biết anh ta đang ở đâu .
có rất nhiều trường hợp giống như những gì đã xảy ra tại <unk> .
điều này đang diễn ra với chúng ta ngày hôm nay .
matthew anderson , tariq <unk> vân vân và vân vân .
hãy tiến lên và bắt đầu phát minh .
đây là vladimir <unk> đến từ <unk> , estonia
có ba nguồn tấn công chính .
cám ơn các bạn .
từ những tội phạm mạng
kiếm tiền !
alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
bjorn <unk> .
