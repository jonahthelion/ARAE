i can see that they are n't very as she will they would be . <eos>
just if they do make sense food that would be on to do this . <eos>
nothing to it , not serving either and the chicken was dry and dry . <eos>
the meat tasted fishy and i thought i has put in in my mouth . <eos>
i 've tried _num_ different dishes and they were were average average at best . <eos>
i just left , probably have have taken a few mile for the internet . <eos>
the chicken lo mein was the worst of of my i have ever had . <eos>
the chicken in the dish was good but the beans were too too great . <eos>
anyway , she got our coffee and will not return to this location . <eos> the
if you go go to one of those except the apple one one . <eos> the
i explained my explained as my husband was at work with our reservation . <eos> the
i can not wait to see this business due due to the facility . <eos> the
but man , it 's just no anything special , but mediocre overpriced . <eos> the
so , , i come here with a drink and we sit down . <eos> the
even on that note , i give it _num_ _num_ out of _num_ . <eos> the
i did n't order it being seen less than any other starbucks . <eos> the the
a a little more sour taste : the chicken in my mouth . <eos> the the
small , dirty in a do n't let me kind of way . <eos> the the
he also said he did n't see it as a a problem . <eos> the the
she was very rude and upset as if i was my fault . <eos> the the
poorly ran into , i would never recommend or stay here again . <eos> the the
while , there was put in this restaurant and on the walls . <eos> the the
this place 's food does not even taste taste like cafeteria food . <eos> the the
it is white white made to look at ( sour soy sauce . <eos> the the
the place is pretty busy , which seems like a good sign . <eos> the the
gave me a little later and and she there _num_ minutes later . <eos> the the
we also ordered a red chili and a bean bean dip . <eos> the the the
i guess other 's is is good good at some locations . <eos> the the the
i asked her and she asked and she charged my receipt ! <eos> the the the
do n't ever expect the staff to be nice or friendly . <eos> the the the
ok i did not get sick twice _num_ hours away lunch . <eos> the the the
fast food somewhere deep tastes like fast food chinese in madison . <eos> the the the
the chicken tenders to be pretty good quality but really soggy . <eos> the the the
this is the worst starbucks i have ever gone to . <eos> the the the the
i was charged charged for some of my _num_ dogs . <eos> the the the the
the main area is not the best part of town . <eos> the the the the
clearly she had no clue what i was talking about . <eos> the the the the
but that no one would help me get the receipt . <eos> the the the the
they were too to each other and the the customers . <eos> the the the the
well i took one bite and did not eat another . <eos> the the the the
but ... clearly does not get good chinese restaurant . . <eos> the the the the
its like dining in the middle of a major door . <eos> the the the the
i ordered the honey pao chicken ... it was awful . <eos> the the the the
here 's the thing : my dish was $ _num_ . <eos> the the the the
upon entering , the noticed the cafe was packed . <eos> the the the the the
the new and and gravy were loud and rude . <eos> the the the the the
she was ignored ignored and almost at at that . <eos> the the the the the
who who answered the phone lost a bad idea . <eos> the the the the the
really , you could n't give me the truth ? <eos> the the the the the
is a a good thing but a bad thing ? <eos> the the the the the
you they are little drunk i do n't know . <eos> the the the the the
there is just no other way to say it . <eos> the the the the the
was told it would be ready in _num_ minutes . <eos> the the the the the
if i could give a _num_ i would . <eos> the the the the the the
i do n't see what the issue is . <eos> the the the the the the
she said large dogs are no longer welcome . <eos> the the the the the the
anyway , we paid this place a visit . <eos> the the the the the the
first time here , but never to return . <eos> the the the the the the
got the girl the next day , ugh . <eos> the the the the the the
so disappointing , at least it was cheap . <eos> the the the the the the
i avoid this store from now on . <eos> the the the the the the the
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever . <eos> the the the the the the the
the phoenix pharmacy location is even worse . <eos> the the the the the the the
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional . <eos> the the the the the the the
the food is worst tasting as boring . <eos> the the the the the the the
tried this place for lunch last week . <eos> the the the the the the the
that takes them _num_ minutes to make . <eos> the the the the the the the
and she gave me _num_ more chances . <eos> the the the the the the the
however i did not enjoy the food . <eos> the the the the the the the
worst chinese food i 've ever had . <eos> the the the the the the the
i sat there for _num_ hours . <eos> the the the the the the the the
and and kinda how that happens . <eos> the the the the the the the the
instead advertising at its best buy . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the kitchen flat , hell really . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the sales people here are terrible . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it 's very disappointing and unimpressive . <eos> the the the the the the the the
staff is rude and not helpful . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it is not really brown rice . <eos> the the the the the the the the
food was not great at all . <eos> the the the the the the the the
_num_ stars because it 's cheap . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the noodles are huge and gross . <eos> the the the the the the the the
some turned looking owners people . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
i was there _num_ night . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
this place is a mess . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
awful , awful , awful ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the
what a rude staff ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
wo n't be back . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
avoid at all costs ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
worst customer service ever ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
i ordered chicken parm . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
they get screwed right . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
not not great either . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
not a good sign . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
this place is filthy ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
rude rude rude ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the the
_num_ hours ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the the the
no stars ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the the the
very disappointed . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the the the
so disappointed . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the the the
terrible . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the the the the
