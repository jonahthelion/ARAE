i can see that they are n't very as she will they would be . <eos>
just if they do make sense food they would be on to do it . <eos>
nothing to get and not serving correctly and the chicken was dry and dry . <eos>
the meat tasted strange and i knew someone has put in in my mouth . <eos>
i 've tried _num_ different dishes and they were were less average at best . <eos>
i just left , probably could have taken a few weeks for the bus . <eos>
the chicken parm mein was the most ridiculous of the i have ever had . <eos>
the chicken in the dish was good but the noodles were way too much . <eos>
anyway , we got our coffee or will not return to this location . <eos> the
if you must go to give of them except the apple one one . <eos> the
i explained as as as this husband was at work with our truck . <eos> the
i can not wait to see this business due due to the facility . <eos> the
but man , this 's just no anything special , but also overpriced . <eos> the
so anyway , i come here with a friend and we sit down . <eos> the
even on that standard , i would it a _num_ out of _num_ . <eos> the
i did n't understand it being any longer than any other starbucks . <eos> the the
normally a little more sour taste than the point in my mouth . <eos> the the
small , over in a do n't touch anything kind of way . <eos> the the
he also said he did n't see what as a a problem . <eos> the the
she was very rude and upset as if my was my fault . <eos> the the
poorly ran into , i would never recommend or stay here again . <eos> the the
anyways , there was above in this restaurant and on the walls . <eos> the the
this place 's does does not even taste taste like soul food . <eos> the the
it is white rice made to cut by by fat tomatoes sauce . <eos> the the
the place is pretty busy , which seemed like a good sign . <eos> the the
gave a a little extra time and she there _num_ minutes later . <eos> the the
we also ordered a red chile a a diet bean dip . <eos> the the the
i guess other customer service is there good at all locations . <eos> the the the
i ask her she she asked and she asked my reservation ! <eos> the the the
do n't ever expect the staff to be nice or friendly . <eos> the the the
ok i did not get sick till _num_ hours in lunch . <eos> the the the
fast food anywhere ' tastes like fast food in in lv . <eos> the the the
the chicken tenders to be pretty good quality but really soggy . <eos> the the the
this is the worst starbucks i have ever gone to . <eos> the the the the
i was charged too for each of my _num_ dogs . <eos> the the the the
the main area is not the best part of town . <eos> the the the the
clearly she had no idea what i was talking about . <eos> the the the the
but that no one would help me get the truth . <eos> the the the the
they were rude to each other and to the customers . <eos> the the the the
well i took one bite and did not eat another . <eos> the the the the
but ... too does not have good chinese restaurant make . <eos> the the the the
its like dining in the middle of a repair door . <eos> the the the the
i ordered the kung pao chicken ... it was awful . <eos> the the the the
here 's the thing : my dish was $ _num_ . <eos> the the the the
upon entering , the noticed the cafe was empty . <eos> the the the the the
the ones people and floors were loud and rude . <eos> the the the the the
she was ignored unhappy and almost rude with that . <eos> the the the the the
who who answered the phone lost a bad name . <eos> the the the the the
really , you could n't give me the keys ? <eos> the the the the the
is that a good thing or a bad thing ? <eos> the the the the the
if they are little drunk i do n't know . <eos> the the the the the
just is just no other way to say it . <eos> the the the the the
was told it would be ready in _num_ minutes . <eos> the the the the the
if i could give a _num_ i would . <eos> the the the the the the
i do n't see what the issue is . <eos> the the the the the the
she said large dogs are no different welcome . <eos> the the the the the the
nope , we paid this place a visit . <eos> the the the the the the
first time here , but never to return . <eos> the the the the the the
got the hell the next day , ugh . <eos> the the the the the the
so disappointing , at least it is cheap . <eos> the the the the the the
i avoid this store from now on . <eos> the the the the the the the
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever . <eos> the the the the the the the
the pharmacy pharmacy location is even worse . <eos> the the the the the the the
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional . <eos> the the the the the the the
the food is worst cause as boring . <eos> the the the the the the the
tried this place for lunch last week . <eos> the the the the the the the
that takes them _num_ minutes to make . <eos> the the the the the the the
and she gave me _num_ more chances . <eos> the the the the the the the
however i did not enjoy the food . <eos> the the the the the the the
worst chinese food i 've ever had . <eos> the the the the the the the
i sat there for _num_ hours . <eos> the the the the the the the the
major and kinda how that happens . <eos> the the the the the the the the
instead advertising at its best color . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the wifi stinks , security really . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the sales people here are terrible . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it 's very disappointing and forgettable . <eos> the the the the the the the the
staff is rude and not helpful . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it is not really brown rice . <eos> the the the the the the the the
food was not great at all . <eos> the the the the the the the the
_num_ stars because it 's cheap . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the noodles are huge and gross . <eos> the the the the the the the the
some older looking over people . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
i was there _num_ night . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
this place is a mess . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
