i can see that they are n't served as she would they would be . <eos>
do if they do make it food that would be on to do it . <eos>
nothing to it for not prepared hot and the chicken was dry dry dry . <eos>
the meat tasted old and i could he has put in in my mouth . <eos>
i 've tried _num_ different dishes and they were less less average at best . <eos>
i just left , probably have have taken a few weeks for the repair . <eos>
the chicken parm mein was the worst disappointing of any i have ever had . <eos>
the chicken in the dish was good but the noodles were way too much . <eos>
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location . <eos> the
if you go go to one star the use the new one . . <eos> the
i asked i realized as i husband was at work with our friends . <eos> the
i can not wait to this this business due to to the airport . <eos> the
but , , it 's just nothing anything special , and mediocre overpriced . <eos> the
so , , i come here with a group and we sit down . <eos> the
even on that point , i give it a _num_ out of _num_ . <eos> the
i did n't see it without any better than any other hotels . <eos> the the
im a little more taste taste : the chicken in my mouth . <eos> the the
plus , not in a do n't look anything kind of way . <eos> the the
he also said he did n't see it as a a problem . <eos> the the
she was very rude and condescending as if i was my fault . <eos> the the
look managed out , i would never recommend or stay here again . <eos> the the
while , there was there in this restaurant and on the walls . <eos> the the
this place 's food does not even think taste like food food . <eos> the the
it is white rice made to look at than soy beans sauce . <eos> the the
the place is pretty busy , which seemed like a good sign . <eos> the the
gave them a little free time and it there _num_ minutes later . <eos> the the
we also ordered a red red and a grilled under pancake . <eos> the the the
i guess other 's service is only good at some locations . <eos> the the the
i asked her why she was me she would my card ! <eos> the the the
no n't ever expect the restaurant that be nice or friendly . <eos> the the the
ok i did not get sick online _num_ hours from lunch . <eos> the the the
fast food poisoning american food like this food chinese in madison . <eos> the the the
the chicken tenders to be pretty good quality but really soggy . <eos> the the the
this is the worst starbucks i have ever gone to . <eos> the the the the
i was charged too for two of my _num_ dogs . <eos> the the the the
the main area is not the best part of town . <eos> the the the the
clearly she had no idea what i was talking about . <eos> the the the the
but that would one would help me the the receipt . <eos> the the the the
they were rude to each other and to customers customers . <eos> the the the the
well i took one bite and did not eat another . <eos> the the the the
but ... too does not have good chinese restaurant make . <eos> the the the the
its like sitting in the middle of a few door . <eos> the the the the
i ordered the sesame pao chicken ... it was awful . <eos> the the the the
here 's the thing that my dish was $ _num_ . <eos> the the the the
upon entering , i was the interior was packed . <eos> the the the the the
the new people and seating are loud and rude . <eos> the the the the the
she was ignored ignored and almost rude at that . <eos> the the the the the
clearly who answered the phone lost a bad experience . <eos> the the the the the
really , you could n't give me the receipt ? <eos> the the the the the
is that a good thing and a bad thing ? <eos> the the the the the
they they are an crap i do n't know . <eos> the the the the the
there is just no other way to say it . <eos> the the the the the
was told it would be ready in _num_ minutes . <eos> the the the the the
if i could give a _num_ i would . <eos> the the the the the the
i do n't see what the issue is . <eos> the the the the the the
she said hot salads are no longer welcome . <eos> the the the the the the
anyway , we paid this place a visit . <eos> the the the the the the
first time here , but never to return . <eos> the the the the the the
got the next the next day , ugh . <eos> the the the the the the
so disappointing , at least it was cheap . <eos> the the the the the the
i avoid this store from now on . <eos> the the the the the the the
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever . <eos> the the the the the the the
the pharmacy pharmacy location is even worse . <eos> the the the the the the the
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional . <eos> the the the the the the the
the food is n't cause as boring . <eos> the the the the the the the
tried this place for lunch last week . <eos> the the the the the the the
that takes them _num_ minutes to make . <eos> the the the the the the the
and she gave me _num_ more dollars . <eos> the the the the the the the
however , did not enjoy the food . <eos> the the the the the the the
worst chinese food i 've ever had . <eos> the the the the the the the
i sat there for _num_ hours . <eos> the the the the the the the the
total and thats how that happens . <eos> the the the the the the the the
instead advertising at its best red . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the wifi sucks , hell really . <eos> the the the the the the the the
