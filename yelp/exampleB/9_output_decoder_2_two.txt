i can see that they were n't served as she did they would be . <eos>
but if they do make sense food that would be on to do it . <eos>
nothing to not and not served the the the chicken was dry and dry . <eos>
the meat tasted old and i 'd maybe had put in in my mouth . <eos>
i 've tried _num_ different dishes and all were were mediocre average at best . <eos>
i just left , probably could have been the few weeks for the trash . <eos>
the chicken parm mein was the worst of of the i have ever had . <eos>
the chicken in the dish was good but the beans were too too much . <eos>
anyway , we got our coffee and will not be to this location . <eos> the
if you go go to one of those instead the next one instead . <eos> the
i saw i as as i husband was at work with our check . <eos> the
i can not wait to this this car due to to the airport . <eos> the
but then , it 's not nothing anything , , and mediocre overpriced . <eos> the
so then , i come here with my dozen and go sit down . <eos> the
even on that point i i give it out _num_ out of _num_ . <eos> the
i did n't see it without any more than any other starbucks . <eos> the the
almost a little more taste taste - the chicken in my mouth . <eos> the the
plus , not in a very n't look that kind of way . <eos> the the
he also said he did n't see it as a a problem . <eos> the the
she was very rude and annoyed as if i was my fault . <eos> the the
poorly managed into , i would never recommend anyone stay here again . <eos> the the
apparently , there was zero in this store and on the bottom . <eos> the the
this place 's not does not even taste like like it food . <eos> the the
it is white rice made to look at and green sauce sauce . <eos> the the
the place was pretty busy , which seemed like a good sign . <eos> the the
tried them a little free time and she there _num_ minutes later . <eos> the the
we also ordered a red curry and a grilled grilled dip . <eos> the the the
i guess other 's service is only good at all locations . <eos> the the the
i told her _num_ she asked and she gave my keys ! <eos> the the the
do n't ever not the staff to be nice or friendly . <eos> the the the
ok i did not get sick to _num_ hours from lunch . <eos> the the the
fast food poisoning stuff tastes like it food chinese in town . <eos> the the the
the chicken parm to be pretty good quality but really tasted . <eos> the the the
this is the worst starbucks i have ever gone to . <eos> the the the the
i was charged too for two of my dogs dogs . <eos> the the the the
the pool area is not the best part of town . <eos> the the the the
clearly she had no problem what i was talking about . <eos> the the the the
but that no one would help me get the correct . <eos> the the the the
they were rude to each other and to have customers . <eos> the the the the
well i took one bite and did not eat the . <eos> the the the the
but ... too not not have good chinese restaurant that . <eos> the the the the
its like sitting in the middle of a few door . <eos> the the the the
i ordered the sesame chicken chicken ... it was awful . <eos> the the the the
here 's the thing that my sandwich was $ _num_ . <eos> the the the the
upon entering , i noticed the club itself packed . <eos> the the the the the
the new people and were were loud and rude . <eos> the the the the the
she was ignored rude and almost rude at that . <eos> the the the the the
who who walked the phone call a bad experience . <eos> the the the the the
really , you could n't give me the receipt ? <eos> the the the the the
is that a good thing for a bad thing ? <eos> the the the the the
they they are not i i do n't know . <eos> the the the the the
there is just no other way to say it . <eos> the the the the the
was told it would be ready in _num_ minutes . <eos> the the the the the
if i could give a _num_ i would . <eos> the the the the the the
i do n't see what the hype is . <eos> the the the the the the
she said beer items are no longer welcome . <eos> the the the the the the
anyway , we will this place a visit . <eos> the the the the the the
first time here , but never to return . <eos> the the the the the the
got the next the next day , ugh . <eos> the the the the the the
so disappointing , at least it was cheap . <eos> the the the the the the
i avoid this store from now on . <eos> the the the the the the the
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever . <eos> the the the the the the the
the pharmacy location location is even worse . <eos> the the the the the the the
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional . <eos> the the the the the the the
the food is definitely except as bland . <eos> the the the the the the the
tried this place for lunch last week . <eos> the the the the the the the
that takes them _num_ minutes to make . <eos> the the the the the the the
and she gave me _num_ more dollars . <eos> the the the the the the the
however i did not enjoy the food . <eos> the the the the the the the
worst chinese food i 've ever had . <eos> the the the the the the the
i sat there for _num_ hours . <eos> the the the the the the the the
and and thats how that happens . <eos> the the the the the the the the
instead buy at its best . . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the wifi smells , nasty really . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the people people here are terrible . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it 's very disappointing and period . <eos> the the the the the the the the
staff is rude and not helpful . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it is not really flavorful rice . <eos> the the the the the the the the
food was not great at all . <eos> the the the the the the the the
_num_ stars because it 's cheap . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the noodles are huge and gross . <eos> the the the the the the the the
some new office people people . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
i was there _num_ night . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
this place is a mess . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
awful , awful , awful ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the
what a rude staff ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
wo n't be back . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
