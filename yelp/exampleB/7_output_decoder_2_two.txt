i guess tell because they are n't busy as they did it would be . <eos>
do if they do make it food that would be in to do this . <eos>
nothing to the , not cooked the and the food was just as dry . <eos>
the meat tasted weird and i 've one has taken in in my mouth . <eos>
i 've tried _num_ different dishes , all were were better average at best . <eos>
i just left , probably have have a a few minutes for the internet . <eos>
the chicken parm was was the worst worst of my i have ever had . <eos>
the chicken was the dish was good but the sauce were too too much . <eos>
anyway , we got our coffee and will not be to this location . <eos> the
if you go go to one of them instead the next one . . <eos> the
i saw i said as my husband was with work with our group . <eos> the
i can not wait to see this establishment due to to the airport . <eos> the
but yes , it 's not not bad , , but not overpriced . <eos> the
so disappointed , i come here with a week and go go down . <eos> the
all on that point , it give it a _num_ out of _num_ . <eos> the
i did n't see it without any other should any other locations . <eos> the the
more a little better taste taste than the sauce in my opinion . <eos> the the
plus , and and a bad n't look well to of either . <eos> the the
he also said he did n't see how as a a problem . <eos> the the
she was very rude and unprofessional as she she was my fault . <eos> the the
bottom managed into , i would never recommend anyone stay here again . <eos> the the
while , there was there in this store and on the floor . <eos> the the
this place is food does not even taste like like it food . <eos> the the
it is literally rice made me look into than a cream sauce . <eos> the the
the place is pretty busy , but seemed a a good sign . <eos> the the
gave them a little time time and they there _num_ minutes later . <eos> the the
we also ordered a red burrito and a turkey sub burrito . <eos> the the the
i guess customer 's service is not good at all point . <eos> the the the
i told her name she was and she was a bill ! <eos> the the the
we n't ever be the restaurant to be nice or customers . <eos> the the the
ok i did not get home _num_ _num_ hours from there . <eos> the the the
fast food hut actually tastes like food food in in madison . <eos> the the the
the fish used to be pretty good but but really soggy . <eos> the the the
this is the worst starbucks i have ever gone to . <eos> the the the the
i was disgusted charged for my of my _num_ items . <eos> the the the the
the front area is not the best part of town . <eos> the the the the
maybe she had no idea what i was talking about . <eos> the the the the
but that would one would help me the the check . <eos> the the the the
they were way to have other and over the customers . <eos> the the the the
well i took one bite and did not try the . <eos> the the the the
but ... too does not have good value restaurant . . <eos> the the the the
its like _num_ in the middle of a major station . <eos> the the the the
i ordered the turkey chicken chicken ... it was awful . <eos> the the the the
here 's the thing that my sandwich was $ _num_ . <eos> the the the the
upon entering , i was the room itself empty . <eos> the the the the the
the sales and are were were rude and rude . <eos> the the the the the
she was immediately annoyed and never at about that . <eos> the the the the the
who who answered the phone have a bad attitude . <eos> the the the the the
how , you could n't give me the _num_ ? <eos> the the the the the
that that a nice thing you a bad thing ? <eos> the the the the the
they are are zero you i do n't know . <eos> the the the the the
there is just no way way to say it . <eos> the the the the the
was told it would be _num_ in _num_ minutes . <eos> the the the the the
if i could give a _num_ i would . <eos> the the the the the the
i do n't see what the hype is . <eos> the the the the the the
she said no items are no longer open . <eos> the the the the the the
anyway , we wo this place a week . <eos> the the the the the the
first time here , but never to return . <eos> the the the the the the
got the next the next day , again . <eos> the the the the the the
so disappointing , at least it was cheap . <eos> the the the the the the
i hate this store from now on . <eos> the the the the the the the
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever . <eos> the the the the the the the
the drive location location is even worse . <eos> the the the the the the the
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional . <eos> the the the the the the the
the worst is n't : as boring . <eos> the the the the the the the
tried this place for lunch last week . <eos> the the the the the the the
that day them _num_ minutes to make . <eos> the the the the the the the
and she gave me _num_ more dollars . <eos> the the the the the the the
however i did not enjoy the food . <eos> the the the the the the the
worst chinese food i 've ever had . <eos> the the the the the the the
i sat there for _num_ hours . <eos> the the the the the the the the
and and how how that happen . <eos> the the the the the the the the
`` sales at best best . . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the pool sucks , really really . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the people people here are terrible . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it 's very disappointing and tasteless . <eos> the the the the the the the the
staff is rude and not helpful . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it is not really spicy meat . <eos> the the the the the the the the
food was not great at all . <eos> the the the the the the the the
_num_ stars because it 's cheap . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the beans are huge and gross . <eos> the the the the the the the the
some office management people people . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
