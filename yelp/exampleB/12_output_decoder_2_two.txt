i can see that they were n't served as she did they would be . <eos>
but if they do make sense food that would be ready to this it . <eos>
nothing to the was not serving correctly and the chicken was dry and dry . <eos>
the meat tasted fishy and i 'd someone put put in in my mouth . <eos>
i 've tried _num_ different dishes and they were were average average prices best . <eos>
i just left , probably could have taken the few for for the bus . <eos>
the chicken parm mein was the most disappointment of the i have ever had . <eos>
the chicken in the dish was good but the noodles were way too big . <eos>
anyway , we got our food and will not return to this location . <eos> the
if you must go to one of those down the apple one one . <eos> the
i explained the explained as my husband was at work with our early . <eos> the
i can not wait to see this business due to to the facility . <eos> the
but man , it 's just too anything special , but also overpriced . <eos> the
so anyway , i come here with a friend and we sit down . <eos> the
even on that cost , i 've it a _num_ out of _num_ . <eos> the
i did n't understand it being any less than any other starbucks . <eos> the the
normally a little little sour taste like the taste in my mouth . <eos> the the
small , over in a do n't look anything to of way . <eos> the the
he also said he did n't see it as a a problem . <eos> the the
she was very rude and upset as if the was my fault . <eos> the the
poorly managed into , i would never recommend or stay here again . <eos> the the
where , there was above in this restaurant and the the walls . <eos> the the
this place 's food does not even taste taste like food food . <eos> the the
it is white rice made to look deep fried brown beans sauce . <eos> the the
the place is pretty busy , which seemed a a good sign . <eos> the the
gave a a little extra time and she there _num_ minutes later . <eos> the the
we also ordered a red burrito and a vegetable bean dip . <eos> the the the
i guess other 's service is good good about some locations . <eos> the the the
i asked her she she was and she handed my receipt ! <eos> the the the
do n't ever expect to staff to be nice or friendly . <eos> the the the
ok i did not get sick online _num_ hours from lunch . <eos> the the the
fast food n n tastes like fast food chinese in town . <eos> the the the
the chicken tenders to be pretty good quality but really soggy . <eos> the the the
this is the worst starbucks i have ever gone to . <eos> the the the the
i was charged charged for two of my _num_ dogs . <eos> the the the the
the main area is not the best part of town . <eos> the the the the
clearly she had no clue what i was talking about . <eos> the the the the
but that 's one would help me get the correct . <eos> the the the the
they were too to each other and to the customers . <eos> the the the the
well i took one bite and did not eat another . <eos> the the the the
but ... clearly does not have good chinese restaurant make . <eos> the the the the
its like sitting in the middle of a gas door . <eos> the the the the
i ordered the kung pao chicken ... it was awful . <eos> the the the the
here 's the thing : my dish was $ _num_ . <eos> the the the the
upon entering , i noticed the cafe itself packed . <eos> the the the the the
the street and and were were loud and rude . <eos> the the the the the
she was yelling yelling and almost annoyed at that . <eos> the the the the the
who who answered the phone every a bad experience . <eos> the the the the the
really , you could n't give me the receipt ? <eos> the the the the the
is that a good thing but a bad thing ? <eos> the the the the the
`` they are little drunk i do n't know . <eos> the the the the the
there is just no other way to say it . <eos> the the the the the
was told it would be ready in _num_ minutes . <eos> the the the the the
if i could give a _num_ i would . <eos> the the the the the the
i do n't see what the issue is . <eos> the the the the the the
she said large salads are no longer welcome . <eos> the the the the the the
nope , we paid this place a visit . <eos> the the the the the the
first time here , but never to return . <eos> the the the the the the
got the girl the next day , ugh . <eos> the the the the the the
so disappointing , at least it was cheap . <eos> the the the the the the
i avoid this store from now on . <eos> the the the the the the the
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever . <eos> the the the the the the the
the pharmacy pharmacy location is even worse . <eos> the the the the the the the
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional . <eos> the the the the the the the
the food is worst flavored as boring . <eos> the the the the the the the
tried this place for lunch last week . <eos> the the the the the the the
that takes them _num_ minutes to make . <eos> the the the the the the the
and she gave me _num_ more chances . <eos> the the the the the the the
however i did not enjoy the food . <eos> the the the the the the the
worst chinese food i 've ever had . <eos> the the the the the the the
i sat there for _num_ hours . <eos> the the the the the the the the
major and kinda how that happens . <eos> the the the the the the the the
instead advertising at its best shape . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the wifi wifi , security really . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the sales people here are terrible . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it 's very disappointing and forgettable . <eos> the the the the the the the the
staff is rude and not helpful . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it is not really brown rice . <eos> the the the the the the the the
food was not great at all . <eos> the the the the the the the the
_num_ stars because it 's cheap . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the noodles are huge and gross . <eos> the the the the the the the the
some bed looking people people . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
i was there _num_ night . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
this place is a mess . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
awful , awful , awful ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the
