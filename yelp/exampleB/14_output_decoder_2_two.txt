i can see that they are n't very as she says they would be . <eos>
just if they do anything sense food they would be doing to get this . <eos>
nothing to it for not anything the and the chicken was dry and dry . <eos>
the meat tasted strange and i knew someone has put in in my mouth . <eos>
i 've tried _num_ different dishes and they were were far average at best . <eos>
i just left , probably could have taken a few mile for the shuttle . <eos>
the chicken parm mein was the most ridiculous of my i have ever had . <eos>
the chicken in the dish was good but the noodles were way too big . <eos>
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location . <eos> the
if you go go to one of them the the original head one . <eos> the
i explained i explained as my husband was at work in our truck . <eos> the
i can not wait to see this business due due to the facility . <eos> the
but man , it 's just no anything special , and employees overpriced . <eos> the
so anyway , i come here with a friend and we sit down . <eos> the
even on that standard , i give you a _num_ out of _num_ . <eos> the
i did n't cut it being any means than any other starbucks . <eos> the the
normally a much made sour taste like the food in my mouth . <eos> the the
small , in in a do n't touch anything kind of way . <eos> the the
he also said he did n't see it as a a problem . <eos> the the
she was very rude and upset as if the was my fault . <eos> the the
poorly ran into , i would never recommend or stay here again . <eos> the the
anyway , there was above in this restaurant and on the walls . <eos> the the
this place 's food does not even taste like like cajun food . <eos> the the
it is white rice made to cut into red brown soy sauce . <eos> the the
the place is pretty busy , which seemed like a sign sign . <eos> the the
gave a a little extra time and got there _num_ minutes later . <eos> the the
we also ordered a red pepper and a white bean bean . <eos> the the the
i guess other customer services is only good at some locations . <eos> the the the
i ask her she she asked and she bothered my reservation ! <eos> the the the
do n't ever expect the staff to be nice or friendly . <eos> the the the
ok i did not get sick gift _num_ hours from lunch . <eos> the the the
fast food hands al tastes like fast food in in champaign . <eos> the the the
the chicken tenders to be pretty good quality but really soggy . <eos> the the the
this is the worst starbucks i have ever gone to . <eos> the the the the
i was charged charged for two of my _num_ dogs . <eos> the the the the
the main area is not the best part of town . <eos> the the the the
clearly she had no idea what i was talking about . <eos> the the the the
but that no one would help me get the key . <eos> the the the the
they were rude to each other and to the customers . <eos> the the the the
well i took one bite and did not eat another . <eos> the the the the
but ... too does not have good chinese restaurant make . <eos> the the the the
its like dining in the middle of a repair sale . <eos> the the the the
i ordered the kung pao chicken ... it was awful . <eos> the the the the
here 's the thing : my dish was $ _num_ . <eos> the the the the
upon entering , i noticed the cafe was packed . <eos> the the the the the
the street people and chairs were loud and rude . <eos> the the the the the
she was ignored unhelpful and almost about at that . <eos> the the the the the
being who answers the phone having a bad life . <eos> the the the the the
really , you could n't give me the truth ? <eos> the the the the the
is that a good thing or a bad thing ? <eos> the the the the the
why they are little drunk i do n't know . <eos> the the the the the
there is just no other way to say it . <eos> the the the the the
was told it would be ready in _num_ minutes . <eos> the the the the the
if i could give a _num_ i would . <eos> the the the the the the
i do n't see what the issue is . <eos> the the the the the the
she said hot dogs are no luck welcome . <eos> the the the the the the
anyway , we paid this place a visit . <eos> the the the the the the
first time here , but never to return . <eos> the the the the the the
got the hell the next day , ugh . <eos> the the the the the the
so disappointing , at least it was cheap . <eos> the the the the the the
i avoid this store from now on . <eos> the the the the the the the
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever . <eos> the the the the the the the
the phoenix pharmacy location is even worse . <eos> the the the the the the the
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional . <eos> the the the the the the the
the food is n't forgettable as boring . <eos> the the the the the the the
tried this place for lunch last week . <eos> the the the the the the the
that takes them _num_ minutes to make . <eos> the the the the the the the
and she gave me _num_ more dollars . <eos> the the the the the the the
however i did not enjoy the food . <eos> the the the the the the the
worst chinese food i 've ever had . <eos> the the the the the the the
i sat there for _num_ hours . <eos> the the the the the the the the
major and sound how that happens . <eos> the the the the the the the the
instead advertising at its best . . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the wifi wifi , security really . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the sales people here are terrible . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it 's very disappointing and irritating . <eos> the the the the the the the the
staff is rude and not helpful . <eos> the the the the the the the the
it is not really brown rice . <eos> the the the the the the the the
food was not great at all . <eos> the the the the the the the the
_num_ stars because it 's cheap . <eos> the the the the the the the the
the noodles are huge and gross . <eos> the the the the the the the the
some turned dog ladies people . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
i was there _num_ night . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
this place is a mess . <eos> the the the the the the the the the
awful , awful , awful ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the
what a rude staff ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
wo n't be back . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
avoid at all costs ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
worst customer service ever ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
i ordered chicken parm . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
they get neither right . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
atmosphere not great either . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
not a good sign . <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
this place is creepy ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the
rude rude rude ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the the
_num_ hours ! <eos> the the the the the the the the the the the the
